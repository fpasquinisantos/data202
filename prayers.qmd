This semester, we pray according to this general pattern:

- **Monday**: for us as students, as citizens and as neighbors
- **Wednesday**: for those affected by what we study
- **Friday**: *lectio continua*, open to what God will say. (This semester we will choose a reading from the weekâ€™s Lectionary.)
