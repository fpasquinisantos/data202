You should do most labs in teams, but do this lab individually so that you can set up your own environment.

Follow the instructions in these lab exercises:

1.  [Lab 1.1 --- Hello, RStudio!](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/info/601/01introduction/lab/lab11-rstudio.html) --- Follow the instructions in this lab 1.1 HTML file to configure your RStudio environment. There is nothing to submit in Moodle for this exercise.
2.  [Lab 1.2 --- Hello, Dataset!](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/info/601/01introduction/lab/lab12-pets.Rmd) --- Download this R-markdown (Rmd) file, upload it into RStudio, edit it as specified in the document itself, knit/format it, download a ZIP of the final version of all the files, and submit them in Moodle. Notes:
    a.  Create a new sub-directory for this labÂ  in RStudio (e.g., `lab01/`) and do all your work there.\
    b.  Add your name and semester in the header code (e.g., I'd set \"Author Goes Here\" and \"Semester Goes Here\" to "Ken Arnold" and "Fall 2022" respectively).
    c.  Download the dataset read in the markdown file (from here: [data/](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/info/601/01introduction/lab/data)\*) and upload it into a data sub-directory of your lab directory (i.e., `lab01/data/`). With this done, the `read_csv()` command should run properly.\
    d.  Modify the document as specified in the places where you see the ðŸš§ icon. Remove the icon and the lab instructions when you make the required edits. The final document should read like a proper analysis of the given dataset, with no remaining lab instructions. Feel free to add additional material, but leave the provided material in place.Â 
    e.  Download a ZIP of all your lab 1 files by going up one directory level, choosing your `lab01` folder, and running "More"â†’"Export\..." on it.Â  Submit this ZIP file in Moodle.\

    Â  This will be the workflow for all future lab assignments.

Labs will be graded primarily on completeness, but are designed as preparation for homework that is graded on correctness and style. You are strongly encouraged to seek informal feedback on your lab files before submitting them.
