```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment = "")
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

## Setup

Construct the set of people, some who will repay and others who will not.

```{r}
# "Deterministic normal": we expect n * pnorm(x, mu, sd) of n points to be below x.
make_group <- function(n, mean, sd, ...) {
  tibble(score = 0:100) %>% 
    mutate(n = floor(n * pnorm(score, mean, sd))) %>% 
    mutate(delta = c(diff(n), 0)) %>% 
    uncount(delta) %>% 
    select(score) %>% 
    mutate(...)
}

people <- bind_rows(
  make_group(150, 60, 10, repay = TRUE),
  make_group(150, 40, 10, repay = FALSE)
)
```

Make a dotplot of the people.

```{r}
ggplot(people, aes(x = score, fill = repay)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 5, dotsize = .5,
               binpositions = "all", method = "histodot", stackgroups = TRUE)
```
