```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(gapminder)

# Put the data in the Environment
gapminder <- gapminder::gapminder

# Extract the data for the latest year in the dataset, for plots that don't involve year.
gapminder_latest <- filter(gapminder, year == 2007)
```


## Styling and labeling plots

```{r plot-1}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "United States") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_line()
```

## Mapping vs Faceting

```{r plot-2}
countries <- c(
  "China", "India", "United States",
  "Indonesia", "Brazil", "Pakistan",
  "Bangladesh", "Nigeria", "Japan")

gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% countries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_line()
```

## Univariate analysis - Continuous


## Univariate Analysis - Categorical


## Bivariate: Relationship between numerical and categorical


## Ridge Plots!


```{r}
library(ggridges)
ggplot(gapminder_latest, aes(x = lifeExp, y = continent)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = .5)
```


## Is "year" discrete?
