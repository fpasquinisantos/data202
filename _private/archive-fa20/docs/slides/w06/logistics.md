* Lab 05 due Wednesday, as if it were HW 05. Don't worry about implementing all of the edits.

Discussion 3 initial post due tomorrow as usual.

Follow-up timeline:
* Follow-up post will require some reading and thought, due next Tues.
* Homework 6:
  a. get the data (or comparable data), make a first shot at replicating your graph. Goal: an attempt (even if just an empty graph with the right labels) and some questions. If this was too easy, consider challenging yourself with a more interesting graph. If it's too hard to get the data, consider switching to a different graph.
  b. Try out Teachable Machine (or some other machine learning demo). Goal: train a model that works correctly in some circumstances but fails in other circumstances. Write a paragraph of your reflections.
