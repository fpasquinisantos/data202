## HW1

* Needs to be clearer about expected amount of analysis
* What constitutes success at the assignment?

## HW2

* Probably want to use bike sharing dataset, like Harvard and Berkeley hws do.
  * Source is probably https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset -- augmented, but no code to reproduce, and description is vague: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3#Sec5

  * For first week, keep it simple.
  * https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/httlads/BikeRental/toctree.html does it in SQL. Would be nice to do same thing two ways!

## Future
  * Nice mapping: https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/httlads/BikeRental/pandas_and_SQL.html
