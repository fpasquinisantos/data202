## **[Course Calendar](calendar.html)**

# Overview

Students in this course will

* Gain technical proficiency in computational and statistical tools for data management and analytics
* Grow skills in communicating data through both graphics and text
* Practice critical thinking and mindfulness about responsible handling of data
* Refine skills of teamwork, planning, help-seeking, and reflection

## Outcomes

In DATA 202, you will build on what you learned in DATA 101 for computational and statistical tools for working with diverse sets of data and communicating the stories that the datasets tell. You will also grow in your ability to critically evaluate how others have used data in both ethical and correctness aspects.

* **Formulate** a question or problem that can be answered by data
* **Acquire** data responsibly
* **Transform** data faithfully into usable forms
* **Explore** datasets to interrogate their representativeness, build intuition, and generate hypotheses
* **Apply** predictive tools to draw conclusions, evaluating the suitability of these models
* **Communicate** visual and textual data-driven narratives that are useful, faithful, and intelligible to both technical and non-technical audiences
* **Analyze** considerations of responsibility and justice in all of the above practices

Since data vary greatly in form, we will be using programming to enable flexibility. Since Python is prevalent among data scientists, this course is designed to give you practical experience using the Python data science ecosystem.

Your work in this course will probably equip you to put the following keywords on your resume: Python, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (regression and classification, supervised and unsupervised learning), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), SQL

## Meeting Times

Unless otherwise announced:

* On **Wednesdays**, we will meet in SB 354 (the "Gold" lab).
* On **Mondays and Fridays**, we will meet in SB 382.

## Prerequisites

* DATA 175, or DATA 101, or both IS 141 and IS 171, and
* CS 104, CS 106, or CS 108. (A minimum grade of C in CS 108, CS 104, or CS 106 is required.)

A basic comfort with statistics will be very helpful but is not assumed.

## Communication

We will use Piazza to communicate. [Sign up here](https://piazza.com/class/jz4k2urbn8r199).

* Most questions you'd ask the course staff should actually go to Piazza.
* If something is unclear on an assignment, you have some questions about a concept we discussed, or you're having trouble getting some software running, ask a public question. Another student might answer it before the course staff even sees it!
* If you find an interesting article or event, feel free to post a note about it!
* Posts can be public or private, anonymous or not.
* In general, don't post code publicly. If you have to include code, make the post private first so the course staff can decide if it's ok to share.

Please use email for requests for accommodations (missing class, disabilities, mental health, etc.).

# Course Components

## Class Meetings

Our times together as a full class fulfill three purposes:

* Learning technical content, in an environment where we can ask questions and learn from each others' misconceptions.
* Hands-on practice in an environment where we can support each other
* Practice articulating thoughtful critique of perspectives on data science.

Meeting those goals requires that you come. So *attendance is required* unless you talk with me about it. If you have a choice, it will probably be easiest to skip a lab day.

## Labs

Labs will give us weekly practice with basic computational tools. Since there isn't a separate lab time in the schedule, we'll meet in the lab during one of our normal meeting times - typically Mondays.

Labs will be graded by completeness. I encourage you to do labs in pairs, but (as with all assignments) what you submit should be typed by yourself. See the Collaboration section for details.

Our goal is that labs can be completed in the 50 minutes allotted. But if we mis-estimate, or something goes wrong, you'll have some extra time to finish them (see the Due Dates section below).

## Homework

Weekly homework assignments will provide deeper practice with technical and conceptual tools, including communication and reflection.

## Quizzes

There will be frequent quizzes, usually short and at the beginning of class.

## Projects

There is no final exam for this course; instead, students will do two projects, [detailed here](projects.html).

The final course meeting (during the designated final exam period on December 12) will be devoted to final project presentations. Feedback on others' projects will be part of your final project grade, so attendance is mandatory.

## Participation: Class Discussions and Journals

I want to invite you into an ongoing discussion about data and society. Towards that end we will have one 20-minute discussion time during class each week. Your responsibility will be to:

* Read or watch one or two pieces per week.
* Write a brief (less than one page, a few bullet points is fine) journal entry about what you read, which might include some of the following things:
  * a one-sentence summary of the article for your future self
  * a quote and your thoughts about it
  * something you found surprising or cool
  * something you disagree with and/or an article that makes a counter-point
  * something you didn't understand
  * a question this raises for you
* Be prepared to share your thoughts during class.

The goals of the journal submissions are:
- To have some way of giving you credit for preparing for the discussions (Journal entries will form the main part of the Participation grade)
- For the instructors to be able to read beforehand to see how people are thinking about the topic
- To have something for your future self to refer to to remember what we talked about.

To encourage you to read critically rather than memorizing details, quizzes will *not* include details from the readings. (Though quizzes may include something from our discussions.)

Most of the readings will be from a worldview and perspective that is superficially quite different from what we would call a "Reformed Christian perspective". Part of my goal this semester is to start articulating such a perspective. Your thoughtful engagement in class discussions will be extremely helpful towards that end!

# Policies

## Grading

Grades will be determined as follows.

* 10% Labs
* 20% Homework
* 20% Quizzes
* 20% Project 1
* 25% Project 2
* 10% Participation (reading journals and nano-feedback)

We will be using [Moodle](http://moodle.calvin.edu/) for submitting and grading assignments. If something on Moodle doesn't seem right or disagrees with this syllabus (e.g., wrong due date / time), please let me know and assume that Moodle is wrong.

## Due Dates

Due dates will follow a consistent rhythm:

* Each week's lab (if applicable) will be due at noon the day after the lab (typically Tuesday at noon, since labs will typically be on Mondays).
* Homework and project milestones will be due on Thursdays at 10pm.
* Reading / watching journals will be due by the beginning of the class where they're discussed. (This is *not* worth an all-nighter. Get some sleep.)

Late assignments make it harder for us to give feedback fairly and efficiently, so any late assignment risks receiving a grade of 0 at the staff's discretion. If you anticipate needing to submit an assignment late, please let us know at least 24 hours in advance and we can discuss. However, the lowest 2 of each of labs and homework will be dropped.

Feedback on assignments takes significant time for us, so we expect you to take some time to respond to it. We will evaluate how well you have responded to feedback by questions on subsequent assignments and potentially other mechanisms.

## Civil Discourse, Diversity, Inclusion, and Understanding

We will touch on controversial issues in this class. We want to create an environment of mutual respect, even when discussing issues where there is vehement disagreement. So please:

* If something is bothering you, please share it. Even (or especially) if it means disagreeing with the course staff.
* Challenge the idea, not the person.
* Honor each other.

(I welcome suggestions about how to improve this policy.)

## Lids Down Policy

You may not use electronic devices during class, except when explicitly asked to do so by an instructor. Since [multitasking hinders learning for nearby peers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254), fasting from electronic devices during class is a simple way to love your fellow students (and also [helps your learning](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797614524581)). Some students will legitimately need exceptions to this policy for one or more class meetings; please talk with me if you would like to request an exception, and please do not police other students.

I am happy to discuss requests for individual accommodations regarding any aspects of the policies outlined here. The earlier the request, the more likely it is that we will be able to accommodate it. I reserve the right to change any of the policies listed here on a student-by-student or full class basis if necessary.

## Collaboration and Academic Honesty

As the [Calvin Academic Integrity Policy](https://calvin.edu/directory/policies/academic-integrity-policy) says, "At Calvin, the student-faculty relationship is based on trust and mutual respect."

Data science is a fundamentally collaborative endeavor. Collaboration brings the benefits of multiple perspectives, needed to tackle complex problems faithfully and responsibly. But teamwork also brings the risk of one person doing all of the "learning" for the other. And at the end of the day I need to evaluate each student's performance individually. Thus:

* *Collaboration on homework and labs is encouraged.*
* The *write-ups* for HW and lab submissions should be *your own work*. Particularly this means: **never copy and paste code**, from the web or another student! Even if you intend to write exactly the same thing, type it out yourself, from memory. Trust me that this is for your benefit.
* **When** asking for help (and everyone *should* ask for help when they need it), *try to solve the problem on your own first*. This is critical. Then, when you ask for help, share *what you've tried* and *what leads you to think it's not working.* (not just "It's not working!!")
* List what help you received for each problem. (e.g., "Joe helped me understand what this question is asking.")

## Accommodations

If you have a health condition that affects your learning or classroom experience, we want to support you.
Please help us understand what accommodations you need.
You can start either by talking with us or by meeting with a Disability Coordinator, located in 360 Spoelhof Center at the [Center for Student Success](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/center-for-student-success/disability-services/).
Either way, please come and talk with me as soon as you can, ideally within the first two weeks of class, so we can put your accommodations in place within the classroom.

## Wellness and Wholeness

If you experience significant stress or worry, changes in mood, or problems eating or sleeping this semester, please do not hesitate to reach out to the instructors to discuss how we can help. There are also several free resources available to you on campus:

* [Center for Student Success](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/center-for-student-success/) (Tutoring, Coaching, Disability Services and more)
* [Counseling and Wellness](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/counseling-and-wellness/) (confidential!)
* [Health Services](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/health-services/)
* [Career Center](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/career-center/)

Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. Furthermore, please notify the professor if you are comfortable in doing so.

# Resources

## Software

We will be using Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks. The lab computers in SB 354 & 372 are pre-configured to support this course, so you are free to do all your course work there. (You may use Linux or Windows, whichever you and your lab partner more comfortable with, but I recommend you pick one and stick with it.)

If you would like to work on your own computer, you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

## Textbooks and Other Resources

There is no single textbook for this course; all needed material will be presented in lectures, labs, and homework. However, you may find the following texts useful:

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) with accompanying [lecture videos](https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/).
* [Principles and Techniques of Data Science](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/), the textbook for Berkeley's [DATA 100](http://www.ds100.org/su19/)

Lecture slides (when we do lectures) will be posted [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JbmTGGeovUwqnWdi4FJARt630UWCuI70). Many will be based on material from the courses below, so you can also refer to those resources.

Here are a few [references](resources.html) for software we're using.
