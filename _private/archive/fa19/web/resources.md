## Programming

Introductory:

* [Getting started with Python for research](https://github.com/TiesdeKok/LearnPythonforResearch), a gentle introduction to Python in data-intensive research.

* [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/index.html), by Jake VanderPlas, another quick Python intro (with notebooks).

Core Pandas/Data Science books:

* [The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), by Jake VanderPlas.

* [Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781491957653), by  Wes McKinney, creator of Pandas. [Companion Notebooks](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book)

* [Effective Pandas](https://github.com/TomAugspurger/effective-pandas), a book by Tom Augspurger, core Pandas developer.


Complementary resources:

* [An introduction to "Data Science"](https://github.com/stefanv/ds_intro), a collection of Notebooks by BIDS' [St√©fan Van der Walt](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/st%C3%A9fan-van-der-walt).

* [Effective Computation in Physics](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/physics/9781491901564), by Kathryn D. Huff; Anthony Scopatz. [Notebooks to accompany the book](https://github.com/physics-codes/seminar). Don't be fooled by the title, it's a great book on modern computational practices with very little that's physics-specific.
