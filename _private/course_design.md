# Objectives

How can we listen to data and communicate what it says to other people?

## My personal goals with this course

* Grow Christian perspectives in DS
* Prepare some students for 303 with us
* Identify and equip potential student researchers
* Get tutors for next year

## Student goals

* tech proficiency
  * specifics
    * computational tools (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn)
    * statistical tools (k-NN, linear regression, logistic regression, train/test splits, CV)
  * How measured?
    * Labs: completion indicates basic use of skill
    * Homework: correctness indicates applying skill in new situation
    * Concept quizzes
    * Projects: new situation, find appropriate tech tool
* communication
  * specifics
    * visual communication
    * textual communication
      * interpretation of visuals
      * explanation of analysis concepts
  * how measured
    * homework: practice good visual communication; free response for textual comm
    * quizzes: interpretation, critique TODO
    * projects
* ethics and perspectives: "Invite students into the developing conversation around data, organizations, and people"
  * specifics
    * How DS is used in the world
    * Ethical considerations of data acquisition, analysis, and decisions
    * articles / authors
      * Talithia Williams
      * Joy Buolamwini
      * Kate Crawford (AAAI keynote?)
      * Virginia Eubanks
      * Catherine D'Ignacio
      * Lily Liu
      * CORELS
      * Finale Doshi-Velez
      * Nathan Matias
      * other Berkman people
      * BlackInAI
  * How measured?
    * Reading journals
    * Discussions (not actually measured now??)
    * Quizzes (measure discussion attentiveness)

Comm and Ethics are especially important for those working on teams with tech and data science people.

Meta-goals

* teamwork (projects: document how you worked together? contract?)
* planning (project: identify tasks, blockers, measures; hw: try to figure out how long it will take)
* help-seeking (lab/Piazza: practice asking good questions)
* reflection: Minute Papers, post-assignment reflections

General reflection / mindfulness:
For each assignment, what questions come up regarding:

* ethics
* data provenance
* methodology (assumptions? validity?)
* inference (real-world connections)
* communication (visuals? what wasn't clearly explained?)

Stances:

* Provenance: "How did this data get to me?" -- even to evaluate *Algorithms*, we wanted real data because we want to claim something about real-world performance, but if we don't know what got left out or got over-emphasized, we may make invalid conclusions about algorithm appropriateness.
