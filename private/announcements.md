# Before First Week

Welcome to DATA 202!

We'll be meeting in our classroom space, NH 253, on Monday and Wednesday. (We'll be in the Maroon lab, SB 372, most Fridays.) If you have a laptop, bring it with you.

If you want to get a head start, you can: 

1. Read through the [Syllabus](https://calvin-data-science.github.io/data202/).
2. Start working on Reading 1 on Moodle.
3. See the links on Moodle to try logging into RStudio. (Python in RStudio? What’s going on??? Come to class!)

Please email/Teams us any questions you may have. We're excited to be embarking on this data science journey with all of you this semester.

See you Monday!\
Prof. Arnold


# During first week

Hi DATA 202 students! A few notes and reminders:

1. Remember to complete the first week's reading on Perusall.
  - Spread it out over several sessions; don't try to do it all at once.
  - It will be helpful to have **watched the video** (by Rosling) in Reading 1 by class tomorrow.
2. Remember to complete the after-class quiz and make a post on this week's discussion forum.
3. If it's easy for you, please bring a laptop to class tomorrow. (A tablet might work fine.)
  - We'll start class by working on the Python review exercise ("quiz"), first individually then in clusters. So it'll be helpful to have tried some of that before class, but it's ok if you don't get to it.
  - We'll then do some work with RStudio, Quarto, pandas, and Plotly, just to get your feet wet.

We're looking forward to seeing you in class tomorrow!
Profs Arnold and Santos

# Week 3

Hi DATA 202 friends! A few **quick notes**, then some longer-term stuff you can read later.

- The [office hours poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?21094632-piz3F) **closes today**, so please fill it out ASAP. Tuesday at 2pm is looking good, so I'll try to be in my office at that time this afternoon.
- Even if you're not a CS major, you might enjoy **today's CS social**: 3-3:50pm, Commons Annex Boardroom (upstairs), we'll be making *pixel art* with so many sticky notes that they'd overflow an 8-bit number (maybe even 16-bit!).
- Reading 3 should be done soon, but isn't officially due until Friday. Reading 4 will be posted tomorrow.
  - Perusall assignments *are* graded based on engagement. There was a "Release Grades" button that I hadn't clicked but did now, so you can check things in the Gradebook on Perusall.
  - If you read everything actively and aren't getting credit for it, email me.
  - The Moodle gradebook isn't syncing to Perusall properly for everyone. You have to fix this for each assignment by clicking the reading assignment link in Moodle ([explanation](https://support.perusall.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034998153-Why-aren-t-my-grades-syncing-back-to-the-LMS-)). The gradebook is out of whack in other ways too; fixing it is on my list for this week.

### Bigger picture

- **Quiz 1** is Friday.
  - We aim for under 20 minutes, but we'll allot the last 30 minutes of class.
  - Some weeks will be on paper, others on Moodle; this week will be Moodle
  - You can review the first Python practice quiz.
  - There's another practice quiz up, in this week's Moodle.
  - Topics
    - Anything from CS 104/6/8 (since it's a prerequisite)
    - Anything you've seen more than once so far (e.g., exercises, slides, reading, practice quizzes, ...)
  - Paper notes allowed, and anything in the Notes section of the course website.
    - If there's something you'd want to refer to slides for, ask me in advance and I'll probably put it in the Notes.
  - Memorization of syntax not required, but concepts behind the syntax are required
- We're starting with the Midterm project this week. First task is to find a good plot to work with. We'll use **Discussion 2** to kick this off.
  - It was supposed to be due today, but I forgot to unhide this last week, and to point it out in class, so we'll obviously have to be flexible about the due dates.
  - This doesn't have to be the plot you eventually choose to work with; this is mostly to help each other find plot ideas.
- For the last exercise we had you submit HTML files instead of `qmd`. Quick notes:
  - Make sure to Render
  - Use Export, not save-as
  - Open the file from your computer before submitting to make sure it works.
- I've been collecting some [notes on our tools](https://calvin-data-science.github.io/data202/notes/tools.html). You may refer to these notes during electronic quizzes if needed. You may be particularly interested in the [plotly notes](https://calvin-data-science.github.io/data202/notes/plotly.html)


Looking beyond this week for the midterm project, other steps will be:

1. Pick a plot (first round this week, can revisit at any point later)
2. Analyze an existing plot, sketch the data frame. This should be posted soon.
3. Find and load the data; write a brief critique of the data.
4. Make an initial plot and a todo list of things to improve; sketch ideas for alternative ways to plot the same data
5. Present the original, replication, and alternative plots to the class and in a Quarto report (week 8)

# Week 4

This week we'll round out our discussion of visualizations by looking at various different plot types and a little bit about how Plotly works inside. We'll also sneak in a preview of data wrangling, since often you need to wrangle data into a form needed for your plots. (Next week we'll dive deep into data wrangling with pandas.)

- My regular office hours are Tuesdays 2-3pm, Wednesdays 3-4pm, NH 298 (posted on Moodle for reference) Or just stop by whenever my door is open, or message me to make an appointment. If you want to do lunch or coffee, we can find a time for that too!
- **Exercise 3** has been updated:
  - Updated the intro to specify that your `qmd` file should actually have a few options set.
  - Gave some additional things to aim for on Exercise 5, and an example of what it might look like.
  - Added the usual Reflections section in the report (there's still the usual check-in "quiz" from Friday class; not many people filled that out)
  - Clarified the difference between Exercises and Parts (sorry, that was confusing).
  - Due on Wednesday.
- The [**Midterm Project** page](https://calvin-data-science.github.io/data202/midterm-proj.html) is updated with descriptions of the **next milestone**. Specifically, you'll be uploading a plot you're considering replicating to a [Plot Gallery](https://moodle.calvin.edu/mod/data/view.php?id=1705052) on Moodle. 
  - Since you already did the hardest part (finding a plot you're interested in) in Discussion 2, this milestone should be done by Friday.
  - This doesn't have to be your final choice of plot. The course staff can work with you to refine your choice.
  - I've uploaded an example.
- **Exercise 2** was graded too harshly, but we're fixing that.
- **Reading 4**, on visualization, should be done by Friday. (We'll probably take some time on Wednesday's class to address things that came up during the reading, so ideally you'd have most of it done by Tuesday so we can prep that.)

We'll get Quiz 1 graded once a few people who weren't in class get to take it. The autograder tends to be too harsh; I usually go back and tweak it to give more credit.

Finally, now that we're trying more open-ended things, our mistakes are getting more interesting. To celebrate them, I've made a "Mistakes Showcase" at the top of Moodle. Thanks to Lillian for our first post there!

See you Monday!


# Week 6: Multiple Tables and Tidy Data

This week we level up our data wrangling skills by working with *relational* data and reshaping data into a *tidy* format. We'll also think more about how data structure relates to visualization structure.

Lots of **upcoming events**:

- **Tuesday 10/3 2-5 pm**: [Computer Science/Engineering Career Fair](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/career-center/events/engineering-computing-fair.html) at Prince Conference Center. Bring resumes, talk with employers, find an internship.
- **Wednesday 10/4 7-9pm**: Third annual Data Science student and faculty gathering at Professor Pruim's house. More info (including rides) and RSVP [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6MK71XAKXtVcJMvTSTrxth0lypWMaZhTROLaRlBzJRs1Q6Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).
- **Tuesday 10/10 4pm and 5pm**: Career-focused info session on new and updated Calvin programs in Business Analytics, Data Science, and Information Systems, by Prof. Pat Bailey. This will be in the Business School building. Contact patrick.bailey@calvin.edu for more info.

Logistics:

- **Reading 6** is up. Sorry for the delay, I finally figured out and solved what was causing the missing figures and (sometimes code) in previous readings. (Solution involed controlling Chrome from Python, ask me if you're curious.)
- Check your **Perusall gradebook** to make sure you've gotten credit for readings. If you're not seeing the grade you expect on Perusall, tell me what assignment and what you did to engage with it, and I'll check on why Perusall isn't giving credit.
- I'm going to try holding my **office hours in SB337** (the social lab) this week (Tues 2-3, Wed 3-4). Go to the SB elevator and turn left.
- The next **project milestone** (set for end of this week) is to make an initial plot. I've cleaned up the [project description page](https://calvin-data-science.github.io/data202/midterm-proj.html) a lot in the past few days, so I recommend reading through it again starting at the top. Note the [**report template**](https://calvin-data-science.github.io/data202/midterm-proj.html#report-template); it's optional but there to help you.
- How's **Exercise 5** going? Ask questions on Perusall (for an experiment, I've tried [uploading it](https://app.perusall.com/courses/23-fa-data-202-a-predictive-analytics/data-202-wrangling-and-analytics-fall-2023-exercise-5-bikeshare-wrangling) to the Perusall library). We might give some more class time to working on it.
- Prof Santos will be grading Quiz 2 soon.

See you on Monday!




# Week 8 (Advising Week Logistics)

Happy Advising break everyone! Some logistics notes:

- Friday in lab
  - Review all of the material from the first half of the course to prepare for Quiz 3 (on Moodle)
  - Have your projects ready to show off to your peers (we'll do an informal *project showcase*). It doesn't have to be perfect; peers can help tweak it up.
- Project logistics
  - I added a Checklist to the project description. This should help you ensure that you're meeting the minimum project requirements. Projects should go beyond those minimums, of course; that's the fun part!
    - Your report should have an Appendix that describes where you went into depth beyond those minimum requirements.
    - There's also a section to discuss what your level of comfort is for sharing your project with future students or beyond.
  - Don't forget the Presentation (VoiceThread) part. Next week, you'll look at a few other students' projects and give some constructive comments; the presentation is mostly to help do that.
    - If you're a team, one person "submit"s the VoiceThread assignment; the other team members go in and add comments. 
    - No need for any fancy styles for the presentation, stick to the defaults and the outline given.

For the Data section of the project, you might find it helpful to review the first few chapters of the textbook (Reading 1). For the plot analysis and critique, you might want to review the Graphics Principles Cheatsheet. I also suggest skimming through the following:

- The section of Wilke corresponding to the type of plot you're working with; see the [Directory in Chapter 5](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/directory-of-visualizations.html). The detailed sections start at [Chapter 6](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-amounts.html).
- Find an interesting section in Wilke's Part II (e.g., [color pitfalls](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-pitfalls.html))
- Chapter 29 [Telling a story and making a point](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html) would have been an assigned reading for this week if we'd had one.

I'm not holding normal office hours this week because of advising, but if you need help, send me a Teams message. Yuqian (Eason) may also be able to help.

PS - The gradebook is now in better shape, but there are still some issues. One common one is that Perusall grades might not be syncing. If any of your Perusall grades are missing, **click the link on Moodle to the corresponding assignment**; that supposedly fixes the sync problem.

# Project Peer Feedback

Hey data scientists,

Congratulations on finishing your first data science projects! This is the week where we give each other constructive feedback. Here's how to do that:

1.  In the Project Presentations activity, click Student Gallery. (It'll say "no threads" for a few seconds until it loads)
2.  In the top-right corner, select "Sort threads", then "Last name".
3.  Click the presentation that comes *just after *your own. Add one or more comments. Be **supportive and substantive**(don't just say "good job"). You might phrase your suggestions in the form of questions or "what if" ideas. Refer to the [Checklist](https://calvin-data-science.github.io/data202/midterm-proj.html#checklist) if needed, though of course the [presentation](https://calvin-data-science.github.io/data202/midterm-proj.html#presentation) won't include everything that the report does.
4.  Look for any comments made on your own presentation. If that gives you an idea of something you could improve, you have until this Friday to make the improvements and resubmit. (You don't need to update the presentation, unless the comment pointed out something you forgot to include in the presentation.)

If you want feedback on your report too, you can email your HTML document to the person/team who would give you feedback on your presentation (see step 3).

If you didn't yet submit a complete project, *your submission is late*; reports and presentations were due on Friday. The "extension" is giving you a chance to revise a complete project, not to finish an incomplete project. Get it in ASAP.

PS -- The Science Division poster fair is this Friday, 12:30-3:30 all around the Science Building. In past years I've invited DATA 202 students to find and analyze plots from these posters; we might do that again this year. If so, details are forthcoming.

# Week 10: Trees

This week we continue our discussion of supervised learning. We'll first go deeper into how we can set up the task by discussing how we can evaluate a classifier, then we'll study a bit more about how tree-based models work. (Next week we'll look at a bunch more models, including linear models and methods that combine many models.)

Logistics:

- Reading 10 is finally posted. See Perusall for instructions (you don't have to do everything listed in the assignment!).
- Exercise 9 is due Wednesday; bring any questions to class Monday.
- the discussion forum on the poster fair was optional... but only one person has posted so far! If you went, share your reflections--even if you forgot to take pictures.
- Quiz 4 is this Friday, and is cumulative. I strongly suggest you review your prior quizzes and exercises.
- Thanks for your revisions on the replication projects! We'll hopefully start getting feedback to you soon.

We'll be starting final projects soon; start thinking about what you might want to do! (The instructions on the website need updating, but they should give the general idea.)


# Week 9: Modeling intro, vis replication project

This week we start modeling, which is what some people consider the coolest and most useful part of data science. Some people even go so far as to call it “AI”.

- Plan to drop by the STEM Division Summer Research Poster Fair on Friday, October XXXXXXXXX from 12:30-3:30 pm in the Science Complex. The discussion post this week will be about plots you see there. See the Forum for details and pointers about how to do this respectfully. I'll try to make our exercise on Friday shorter so that you can swing by at the end of class in case your schedule is otherwise jammed.

# Week 9: Modeling and Ethics

- Read MDSR chapter 8, [Ethics](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-ethics.html).
  - Note: The discussion there is secular and left-leaning.
  - As you read, try to identify at least one point of *resonance* with a Reformed Christian perspective, and at least one point of *tension*.
- Finish working through the Google "[attacking discrimination](http://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/)" example that we started in class.
  - Note that this whole scenario requires knowing something that is not knowable: the distinction between light and dark grey people.
  - Explain each of the objectives in your own words. For each one, identify *who* would prefer that objective. For example, a big bank might prefer the "max profit" objective because they're legally required to make decisions to maximize value to their shareholders. Who might prefer "group unaware"? "Demographic parity"? "Equal opportunity"?
  - Which of the objectives do you think is most "right"?


# Unit 13

Last week of class!

Regarding the second midterm exam: instead of holding it in class, it'll be a [wrap-up homework](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/data/202/21fa/hw/hwFinal/hwFinal-inst.html). Officially it'll be due on Reading Recess, but extensions will be freely granted.  Given the short time, I tried to keep it small.
(Why? We didn't get enough quiz/homework practice on the material in the second half to make me comfortable giving a high-stakes exam on it.
This is a bug with how I scheduled things this year.)

We'll be in the classroom both days this week:

- Monday we'll discuss communication and reporting.
- Come to class on Wednesday ready to reflect on all our Discussions this semester. So you should have Discussion 12 done by then. We'll also take a few minutes to do course evaluations.

As I mentioned in class, I'm expecting that most project teams will want to meet with me at least once for some reason or another. In anticipation of that,
I am not holding regular office hours this week; just message me and we'll find a time.

See you in class!

# Unit 12

We're approaching the end, folks! Although our main focus will be final projects,
we'll be taking the last 5(!) days of class to discuss some additional useful
topics to round out your data science expertise, including geospatial data,
text data, and more data science ethics.

Logistics:

- I have created team repos for your final projects.
  - Find your team's repo by going to our [class GitHub organization](https://github.com/Calvin-DS202-21FA) and finding the `proj-` repo with your name on it.
  - Each person on the team has read/write access to the repo.
  - If the team membership is incorrect in any way, please let me know ASAP.
  - You can each make your own clones of the repo, or you can "Share Project" for a "Google Docs" collaborative editing experience. See the [project sharing documentation](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/211659737-Sharing-Projects-in-RStudio-Workbench-RStudio-Server-Pro) for details.
  - Remember to knit-commit-push often, whether you're using separate clones or a shared project. If you're using a shared project, acknowledge who did what work in the commit message.
- Please submit your milestones under the Final Project assignment in Moodle.
  - You should be able to update the submission as you progress.
  - Only one person from each team needs to submit; Moodle is configured so that everyone on a team shares that assignment.
  - Select "Knit to PDF" to make a PDF for submission (normally knitting will make just an HTML document, which is faster but doesn't show up well in Moodle).
- The next milestone is to have some exploratory visualizations and analyses of your data. That is, you should have the EDA section of your report complete, and a good start on everything before that. See the suggested report outline in the [project spec](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/data/202/21fa/projects.html#Project_2_Detailed_Expectations) for details.
- Discussion 12, on recommendation systems, is due Tuesday. The readings there could be fodder for family discussions. (Sorry I didn't remind you about this before Thanksgiving.)
- If you didn't get to Prep 12 last week, this would be a good time: we're reading about [SQL](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-sql.html), [Geospatial](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-spatial.html), and [Text](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-text.html). This could also be a good time to skim any of the other chapters that we haven't covered. In particular, check out [chapter 14](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-vizIII.html) for some tools that may be useful for your project.

# Final Presentation Notes

Good work to those who presented today! Here are a few things that came up for several presentations, so I thought I'd share them with the whole class:

- What does each row of the data represent?
- If you're doing predictive modeling, be very clear about what your *task* is:
  "I'm trying to predict the XXX of each YYY based on measures of ZZZ".
- Make your plots and tables *human-friendly*:
  - Label plots with meaningful names (vs, say, "model1")
  - Show only the important stuff (vs, say, every single column of your data including ones you're not using)
  - `knitr::kable` your tables
  - Consider using `comment = ""` as a chunk option. e.g., my `setup` chunk often contains `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment = "")`
  - Show stuff in inline code. *For an example of how to do this for model accuracy, search for `model1_accuracy_estimate` in [Exercise 10](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/data/202/21fa/ex/ex10/ex10-validation-inst.html).
- Do your data wrangling *once*, especially *before* splitting into train and test, so that the only difference between the datasets is which rows are included in which one.
- The projector in the classroom is 4x3, so "wide" presentations will run off the edge of the screen.

Meeting in the classroom worked well today, so let's do that again tomorrow. Even those who presented today are also welcome tomorrow; there's enough room.
