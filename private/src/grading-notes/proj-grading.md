## Milestone 1

Nothing submitted. Please get this in ASAP. See https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/data/202/21fa/projects.html#how-to-pick-a-plot for some direction.

What's the claim that the authors were making?

Interesting claims are often about relationships. See https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/data/202/21fa/projects.html#How_to_pick_a_plot for some guidance. (This could still make a moderately interesting project but I think a small shift now could help it be a lot more interesting in the end.)

I'm marking this at a bit less than 100% because I'm concerned that without a single clear claim you'll have trouble making an interestingly different alternative design for this visualization.

Regarding the data source, see the note here: https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/data/202/21fa/projects.html#Your_data
