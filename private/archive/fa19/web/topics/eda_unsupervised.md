# Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, and Unsupervised Learning

## Reading

Please read [Chapter 5](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/05/cleaning_intro.html) in the textbook.

There's some very good material in there but it also gets into a lot of detail. So **suggested strategy**: skim the whole chapter, then come back and pay more attention to specific sections.

Also skim [The Quartz guide to bad data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide). It's fascinating and practical.

## Unsupervised Learning

* Play with this [interactive k-means clustering demo](https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering/)
* To get a sense of some of the other clustering algorithms out there, check out the GIFs on [this blog post](https://dashee87.github.io/data%20science/general/Clustering-with-Scikit-with-GIFs/).

## Applications

* A nice example of analyzing a different kind of bicycle use data: https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/07/23/learning-seattles-work-habits-from-bicycle-counts/
