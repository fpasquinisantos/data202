# Vis assignment

We're going to have a visualization workshop in class! We'll be looking at a few of the visualizations that you've been working to replicate from Project 1. To prepare for that, please do the following reading and response. Your answers will help us choose which visuals to look at.

* Read [Chapter 29](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html) of [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) by Claus O. Wilke. (Also skim the [Introduction](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/introduction.html) to understand the "bad" and "ugly" labels on some of those visuals.)

* Now look through [chapter 5 (Directory of visualizations)](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/directory-of-visualizations.html). **Which of these categories best describes the visualization you're replicating for Project 1?**

* Now, read the chapter that corresponds to that visualization category. **Refer to that chapter to answer the following questions** about the visualization you're replicating:

1. What is something that the visualization you're replicating does *well*?
2. What is something that could be improved about the visualization you're replicating?

Now referring to ch29:

3. **What story is your article telling about the figure**? (If the last two milestones, you hopefully identified the *claim* that the article was using the visualization to support.  That's probably the core of the story.)
4. Probably you currently have a *single* figure. **How might you use multiple figures to tell that story** (or another one?)
