# Role in the Data Science program

* Connects computation, statistics, and application.
* Technical foci:
    * reproducible and collaborative workflow (Git, Rmd / notebooks)
    * overall: tabular data with conventional data types
    * data wrangling (tidyverse, Pandas?)
    * applied visualization (ggplot)
    * applied modeling (predictive and inferential)
* Societal foci:
    * How data affects you, and how data about you is used by others
    * Impacts of Data and AI in society; governance
    * Ethical considerations of data collection and usage

As a follow-up to DATA 101:

* Translate knime analyses into code (version control, adaptability, documentation)
* Apply and practice visualization concepts

As a follow-up to CS 106/108:

* Apply computational thinking and the language of coding to expressing operations on tabular data

As a companion to STAT:

* Practice with tools of data wrangling and visualization
* Practice applying statistical modeling tools to messy datasets
* Predictive application, not just inference



# Incoming SLOs



Students are expected to master technical subjects and skill sets to support project planning and working on a team. At the completion of the course, students should be able to:

* Use technology to plan and execute work in a team.

    +Explain the systems view of the data life cycle.
    ^Apply the appropriate structure, formatting and processing for usage of data within and between systems
    Apply algorithmic concepts to the analysis of data in a distributed parallel framework such as Hadoop, Spark, or similar technology.
    +Extract data from multiple sources (e.g., SQL vs. No-SQL databases, structured vs. unstructured files, streamed vs. static data), transform it as needed, and load the data into other systems for further analysis, appropriately selecting technology for the scale and complexity of the data involved.
    Understand Christian perspectives and issues of ethics and compliance as they relate to data
    “*” = Recommend dropped
    “+” = Recommend revise as appropriate
    “^” = Explicitly move a portion to Data 101
