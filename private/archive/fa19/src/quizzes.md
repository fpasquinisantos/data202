# Classification

## Accuracy and Fairness

* Two classification algorithms, called A and B, were tested on a set of 1000 lending customers. Algorithm A predicted whether or not the customer would repay the loan correctly for 900 customers and incorrectly for 100 customers. Algorithm B predicted correctly for 850 customers are incorrectly for 150 customers. Which algorithm is better?

  * A
  * B
  * **more information is needed** (specifically, FP vs FN)

* Pick two definitions of "fairness" and contrast them.

# EDA

* Name two things you could check about a dataset of hourly temperature to check that it is appropriate for further use.
  * range of times
  * number of rows
  * range of temperature values over year
  * Seasonal / hourly variation

# Grammar of Data

* Name the "Grammar of Data operation that could best be used for the given task:

  * Given a table of bike rides (each record containing time, starting station, and ending station), compute the number of bike rides per hour: **aggregate (count)**
  * Given a table of bike rides by hour, add a column for temperature: **join**
  * Consider only rides that happened on weekends: **filter/query**
