<p>Suppose we want to predict ridership in Capital Bikeshare for the current year. The data we've been using so far only covers 2011 and 2012... much too far in the past. Capital Bikeshare has released more recent ridership data, but it's only ride logs,
    without the temperature, holiday, and other helpful features that the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset">University of Porto</a> data had. And<i> <b>they didn't release their code</b></i><b>...</b><br></p>
<p>Let's try to wrangle the data ourselves. If we can do that, then we can easily extend it to more recent data.</p>
<p>The attached notebook has the code you'll need to fetch the raw data to get started. Your goal is a dataframe that looks like this (showing every 1000th row):<br></p><br>

<div>To simplify the problem, consider only rides by Members ("registered" in the Porto data). (Your table may not match exactly due to legitimate differences in how to process this data.)<br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This is a challenging task. To help break it down, <b>start by making a diagram of the process</b>. At each step, show what the data currently looks like (relevant column headers, one example row, and a note of what each row represents). Label the arrows
    with what operation you'll perform (in English, not code) to get to the next step. Example:</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><img src="https://moodle.calvin.edu/draftfile.php/1261568/user/draft/584695432/process-workflow-example.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" class="img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom" width="300" height="331"></div>
<div><br></div>
<div><b>Note</b>: The example solution only has one loop (and even that's not necessary if you do it in a different order). If you find yourself wanting to write loops, think instead about how to express the operations using the "Grammar of Data" we've been
    discussing (grouping, querying, joining, ...).<br></div>

<div>Grading is as follows: <br></div>
<div><br></div>
<ul>
    <li>10%: <b>Asked a good question on Piazza.</b></li>
    <li>10%: Process flowchart is correct and reasonably complete<br></li>
    <li>5%: Steps are documented in the submitted notebook<br></li>
    <li>5%: Code is reasonably clear and avoids loops for major steps.</li>
    <li>20%: date, hour, and rides columns are correct</li>
    <li>25%: temperature column is correct</li>
    <li>20%: is_holiday column is correct</li>
    <li>5%: is_weekend and is_workingday columns are correct<br></li>
</ul><br>
