## Questions for you

- How is week 3 of Fall 2020?
- What's working well in DATA 202? What's challenging?

--


- How are the readings and prep exercises?
- How long are you spending on labs outside of class?
- How hard are labs compared with homework?


---

## So far

* *R/RStudio/Rmarkdown/Git*: a toolkit for reproducible collaborative analysis and reporting
* `ggplot2`: a *Grammar of Graphics*
  * a language for describing, and building, visualizations
  * concepts apply to many other toolkits

This week:

* `dplyr`: a *Grammar of Data Transformation*
  * basic concepts will show up again in Python (Pandas) and SQL.

# Data wrangling and summarizing<br> with *dplyr*

## A grammar of data wrangling

Functions as verbs that manipulate data frames

.pull-left[
```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align = "center", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.midi[
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: pick rows by index(es)
- `slice_sample`: randomly sample rows
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarize`: reduce variables to values
- `pull`: grab a column as a vector
- ... (many more)
]
]

---

## Rules of *dplyr* functions

- First argument is *always* a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always return a data frame
- Don't modify in place

---

## Bike crashes in NC 2007 - 2014

```{r include=FALSE}
ncbikecrash <- read_csv(here::here("docs/data/ncbikecrash.csv"))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash <- read_csv("data/ncbikecrash.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(ncbikecrash)
```


---

## Variables

View the names of variables via
```{r}
names(ncbikecrash)
```

and see detailed descriptions [here](https://introds.org/hw/hw-02/hw-02-bike-crash.html).

---

## Select columns

.midi[
```{r}
select(ncbikecrash, county, bike_age)
```
]

--

.question[
What if we wanted to select these columns, and then arrange the data in ascending order of biker age?
]

---

## Data wrangling, step-by-step

.midi[
.pull-left[
Select:
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(county, bike_age)
```
]
.pull-right[
Select, then arrange:
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(county, bike_age) %>%
  arrange(bike_age)
```
]
]

# Pipes

---

## What is a pipe?

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another.

--

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `ncbikecrash`
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% #<<
  select(county, bike_age) %>%
  arrange(bike_age)
```
]

---

## What is a pipe?

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another.

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `ncbikecrash`,
- then we `select` the variables `county` and `bike_age`,
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(county, bike_age) %>% #<<
  arrange(bike_age)
```
]

.pull-left[

]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(county, bike_age) %>%
  arrange(bike_age) #<<
```
]

---

## How does a pipe work?

Conventional (nested functions):

```{r eval=FALSE}
arrange(select(ncbikecrash, county, bike_age), bike_age)
```

With pipes:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(county, bike_age) %>%
  arrange(bike_age)
```

---

## What about other arguments?

Use the dot (`.`) to

- send results to a function argument other than first one or 
- use the previous result for multiple arguments

```{r fig.height=1.8, fig.width = 3.75}
starwars %>%
  filter(., species == "Human") %>%
  lm(mass ~ height, data = .) #<<
```

---

## A note on piping and layering

- The `%>%` operator in **dplyr** functions is called the *pipe* operator. This means you "pipe" the output of the previous line of code as the first input of the next line of code.
- The `+` operator in **ggplot2** functions is used for "*layering*". This means you create the plot in layers, separated by `+`.
- Many of the styling principles are consistent across `%>%` and `+`:
  - always a space before
  - always a line break after (for pipelines with more than 2 lines)

---

## `select` to keep variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(locality, speed_limit) #<<
```

---

## `select` to exclude variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(-object_id) #<<
```

---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(starts_with("bike_")) #<<
```

---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(ends_with("age")) #<<
```

---

## Select helpers

- `starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix
- `ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix
- `contains()`: Contains a literal string
- `num_range()`: Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
- `one_of()`: Matches variable names in a character vector
- `everything()`: Matches all variables
- `last_col()`: Select last variable, possibly with an offset
- `matches()`: Matches a regular expression (a sequence of symbols/characters expressing a string/pattern to be searched for within text)

.footnote[
See help for any of these functions for more info, e.g. `?everything`.
]

---

## `arrange` in ascending / descending order

.pull-left[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(ends_with("age")) %>%
  arrange(bike_age) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(ends_with("age")) %>%
  arrange(desc(bike_age)) #<<
```
]

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

First five

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:5) #<<
```

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

Last five
 
```{r}
last_row <- nrow(ncbikecrash)
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice((last_row - 4):last_row) #<<
```

---

## `sample_n` / `sample_frac` for a random sample

- `slice_sample`: randomly sample `n = 5` observations

```{r}
ncbikecrash_n5 <- ncbikecrash %>%
  slice_sample(n = 5, replace = FALSE) #<<
dim(ncbikecrash_n5)
```

--

- `sample_frac`: randomly sample `prop = 20%` of observations

```{r}
ncbikecrash_perc20 <-ncbikecrash %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 0.2, replace = FALSE) #<<
dim(ncbikecrash_perc20)
```

---

## `filter` to select a subset of rows

Crashes in Durham County

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(county == "Durham") #<<
```

---

## `filter` for many conditions at once

Crashes in Durham County where biker is 0-5 years old

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter( #<<
    county == "Durham",     #<<
    bike_age_group == "0-5" #<<
    ) #<<
```

`<`         | less than                    ||`x`&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;`y`     | `x` OR `y` 
`<=`        |	less than or equal to        ||`is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`
`>`         | greater than                 ||`!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`
`>=`        |	greater than or equal to     ||`x %in% y`    | test if `x` is in `y`
`==`        |	exactly equal to             ||`!(x %in% y)` | test if `x` is not in `y`
`!=`        |	not equal to                 ||`!x`          | not `x`
`x & y`     | `x` AND `y`                  ||              |

.question[
Fill in the blanks for filtering for crashes **not** in Durham County where crash year is after 2014 and `bike_position` is not `NA`.
]

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(
    county ____ "Durham", 
    crash_year ____ 2014,
    ____
    )
```

---

.question[
Fill in the blanks for filtering for crashes **not** in Durham County where crash year is after 2014 and `bike_position` is not `NA`.
]

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(
    county != "Durham",   #<<
    crash_year > 2014,    #<<
    !is.na(bike_position) #<<
    )
```

---

## `distinct` to filter for unique rows

... and `arrange` to order alphabetically

.pull-left[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  distinct(county) %>% #<<
  arrange(county)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  select(county, city) %>% 
  distinct() %>% #<<
  arrange(county, city)
```
]

## Code Style

>"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."
>
>Hadley Wickham

- Recommended: Tidyverse style guide <https://style.tidyverse.org/>

---

## Summary

* File names and code chunks: `data-wrangling`, not `Data Wrangling`.
* Variable names: `hourly_rides`, not `hourlyRides` or `hourly.rides` or `rides_by_hour_with_weather`
  * Informative but short. Don't reuse.

---

## Spacing

- Put a space before and after all infix operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.), and when 
naming arguments in function calls
- Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

---

## ggplot2

- Always end a line with `+`
- Always indent the next line

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Bad
ggplot(diamonds,mapping=aes(x=price))+geom_histogram()
```
