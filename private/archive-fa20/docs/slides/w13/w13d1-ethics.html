# A bit of thinking about data ethics
### K Arnold, based on DSBox and others

## Logistics

* Project rubric, details, and logistics posted!
* *Unofficial* milestone: make some plot using your data before Thanksgiving

---

## Q&amp;A / Review

&gt; Why did we use such a huge `set.seed` last time?

*Today's date*!

---

## Q&amp;A / Review

&gt; Why did a bigger `step_range` make the feature more prominent?

## Today: A Series of Mini Discussions

Preview of questions:

* What characterizes an ethical data scientist or analyst?
* What are some ways that we have practiced *humility* in this course?
* What are some ways that we have practiced *integrity*?
* What are some ways that we have practiced *compassion and justice*?

&lt;br&gt;

* What are some things we could do that would *compromise* our integrity?
* What are some ways that data-driven systems can *help* or *hinder* truth?
* What are some ways that data systems can help *perpetuate*, or *fight*, injustice?

---

.question[
What characterizes an ethical data scientist or analyst?
]

*Post your thoughts in your Cohort channel*. I will pick a random cohort.

## Our Goals

* *Skill*: how to do these things
* *Knowledge*: understanding the underlying concepts
* *Character*: wisdom in practicing these skills

---

## Character??

DS is a lens. How can we see rightly through it? Some areas:

* Humility
* Integrity / Honesty
* Hospitality
* Compassion and justice

---

## Humility

Challenge: data feels powerful, people listen to what you use it to say.

.question[
What are some ways that we have practiced humility?
]

<div class="countdown blink-colon noupdate-15" id="timer_5fbbd938" style="right:0;bottom:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">02</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">00</span></code>
</div>

???

* R Markdown
* 2 weeks on validation of predictive models
* citing sources in midterm projects

So we will practice:

* Citing all sources (for both data and process)
* Acknowledging limitations
* Transparent process
* Validation of results

Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.

## Integrity

It’s tempting to say something that isn’t entirely true, or to manipulate the collection/analysis/reporting process to yield the answer you want

.question[
What are some ways that we have practiced integrity?

.question[
What are some things we could do that would *compromise* our integrity?

## Recommender Systems and Information

* Why does YouTube recommend some videos rather than others?
* What is YouTube optimizing for? (what brings them money?)

--

* **Time on YouTube**

&gt; Any smart AI that optimizes engagement with itself will have a tendency to discourage engagement to other channels.

* ... which *may* mean that recommendations promote videos that *amplify resentment against other media*.

## Hospitality

We can choose to use our tools to elucidate and clarify, rather than obscure.

So we will practice:

* Clear visual communication
* Clarity of code and process
* Writing explanations that are accessible and appropriate to audience.

???

How have we practiced each of these?

## Compassion and Justice

Data Science can both cause harm and reveal it.

So we will:

* Study examples of how data might cause harm
* Study examples of how harm might be mitigated or revealed

.question[
What are some ways that data systems can help *perpetuate*, or *fight*, injustice?

## Amazon's experimental hiring algorithm

- Used AI to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars - much like shoppers rate products on Amazon, some of the people said
- Company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way
- Amazon’s system taught itself that male candidates were preferable

&gt;Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models’ judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said.

## ProPublica analysis

### Data: 

Risk scores assigned to more than 7,000 people arrested in Broward County, Florida, in 2013 and 2014 + whether they were charged with new crimes over the next two years

---

## ProPublica analysis

### Results:

- 20% of those predicted to commit violent crimes actually did
- Algorithm had higher accuracy (61%) when full range of crimes taken into account (e.g. misdemeanors)
![](img/propublica-results.png)
- Algorithm was more likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, at almost twice the rate as white defendants
- White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants

## Review

.question[
A company uses a machine learning algorithm to determine which job advertisement to display for users searching for technology jobs. Based on past results, the algorithm tends to display lower paying jobs for women than for men (after controlling for other characteristics than gender).

What ethical considerations might be considered when reviewing this algorithm?

## Parting thoughts

- At some point during your data science learning journey you will learn tools that can be used unethically
- You might also be tempted to use your knowledge in a way that is ethically questionable either because of business goals or for the pursuit of further knowledge (or because your boss told you to do so)

.question[
How do you train yourself to make the right decisions (or reduce the likelihood of accidentally making the wrong decisions) at those points?
