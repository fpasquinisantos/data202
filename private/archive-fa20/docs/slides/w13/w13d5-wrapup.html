# Wrap-up: Communication and Justice

## Q&amp;A

&gt; Forecasting vs Prediction?

Forecast = prediction... about the **future** of a **time series**. ([more](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/65287/difference-between-forecast-and-prediction))

&gt; How can we hold big tech companies accountable?

* Regulation (government, or even industry standards)
* B Corporations ("triple bottom line")
* Collective action (Google Walkout, boycotts, etc.)
* Asking hard questions when they try to recruit you

&gt; How do you calibrate a model?

Train another model to predict true probabilities from classifier probabilities (on held-out data). [sklearn tools](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html)

## Making a Data-Driven Argument

---

### Make a point

.pull-left[
**Report A**

MAIN POINT

* Supporting chart 1
* Supporting table 2
* Supporting model 3

Discussion about how each supports main point
]

.pull-right[
**Report B**

* Chart 1
* Table 2
* Model 3
* Chart 4
* Table 5
* Chart 6
* Model 7
* Chart 12
* Table 25
]

---

### Tell a Story

* Chart 1
* Therefore, chart 2
* BUT, chart 3

[but-therefore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGUNqq3jVLg)

---

### Anchor conclusions in data

.pull-left[
* The units are probably seconds&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* The fit looks good&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* This was surprising
]

--

.pull-right[
* because the median, 600, would be 10 minutes
* because the mean error of $15 is less than 0.1% of the price
* because I expected that people would leave higher ratings on products they enjoyed more
]

---

### Use appropriate language

.pull-left[
**Plain language** for the overview, conclusion, and visuals.

* Labels in visuals: use real names, not `code_names`. (For all aesthetics, not just x and y.)
* Don't assume the reader knows the structure of the data.
]

.pull-right[
**Technical language** when describing methods (data acquisition, wrangling, modeling, etc.).

* What data representation choices did you make? *why*?
* What modeling choices? Why? etc.
]

## Final Thoughts on Data + Justice

With enormous thanks to:

Tim Keller, [A Biblical Critique of Secular Justice and Critical Theory](https://quarterly.gospelinlife.com/a-biblical-critique-of-secular-justice-and-critical-theory/)

---

Keller's bullet-point summary of biblical justice:

* Community above individual (voluntarily)
* Equity: equal treatment, dignity
* Collective responsibility
* Individual responsibility
* Advocacy for poor and marginalized

.question[
What does biblical justice require, in the area of data science?
]

*Post your thoughts in your Cohort channel*.

<div class="countdown blink-colon noupdate-15" id="timer_5fce3e93" style="right:0;bottom:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">03</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">00</span></code>
</div>

---

### Some things you pointed out in Discussion

* Care for people *together with* care for environment
* Care for individual people affected, not just general economic impacts
* Cherishing and celebrating what God has made (people, natural resources) instead of exploiting
* Need safeguards to protect from the effects of sin

some scripture you mentioned:

* Isaiah 56:1, Psalm 82:3

---

### Community

&gt; The righteous (*saddiq*) are willing to disadvantage themselves to advantage the community; the wicked are willing to disadvantage the community to advantage themselves.

So:

* privacy
* integrity in data collection, analysis, reporting, communication

---

### Equity: Everyone must be treated equally and with dignity.

* *direct* impact
  * fair risk assessment (see Discussion and COMPAS)
  * fair resource allocation
  * fair surveillance (don't hyper-surveil the poor etc.)
* *indirect* impact:
  * don't show ads for criminal background checks more often for Black names
  * don't tolerate higher speech reco error rates for minorities
  * show a representative diversity of age/gender/race/... in image searches

---

### Should we even be predicting peoples' lives?

* Risk assessment for criminality, loan approval, etc. requires predicting
  peoples' future actions and situations
* These predictions might be terribly inaccurate. *Should we be trying at all*?

Salganik et al, [**Measuring the predictability of life outcomes with a scientific mass collaboration**](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8398.short). PNAS, April 2020

&gt; Despite using a rich dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model.

---

### Corporate responsibility: I am sometimes responsible for and involved in other people’s sins.

* Even if *I* intend no prejudice, my *algorithm* could be prejudiced because of training data.
* Even if my work is honest, I could be supporting a company that exploits other
  workers directly or rely on conflict minerals and [child labor](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-50812616)
* Environmental responsibility is both individual and collective

???

http://opiniojuris.org/2020/01/13/the-mighty-apple-google-tesla-dell-and-microsoft-in-the-dock-a-look-at-the-child-labour-lawsuit/

---

### Individual responsibility: I am finally responsible for all my sins, but not for all my outcomes.

* I must do what's right, whether or not my company's policies require it.
* When something isn't right, I need to say something even if it risks my job.

---

### Advocacy: We must have special concern for the poor and the marginalized.

* By **listening to** and **amplifying**, not **speaking for**.
* e.g., beware of doing "parachute research" or de-contextualized "Data for Good"

---

### Incarnation

.scripture[
```
In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
Who, being in very nature God,
    did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
rather, he made himself nothing
    by taking the very nature of a servant,
    being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man,
    he humbled himself
    by becoming obedient to death—
        even death on a cross!
```
.ref[Philippians 2:5-8, NIV]

## "What can I do?"

* Choose jobs carefully ([How to Interview a Tech Company](https://medium.com/@AINowInstitute/how-to-interview-a-tech-company-d4cc74b436e9))
  * You *can* make a difference inside even a "bad" company--but recruit a support network like a missionary.
* Listen a lot. To diverse opinions.
* Keep in touch.
