Find a news article or opinion piece about that issue and try to replicate a visual that they’d use to support their claims. The strongest such projects will pick a claim that you disagree with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4: Plot selection and initial analysis\nUpload a screenshot of one or more potential plots to the Plot Gallery. Your post should include:\n\nScreenshot: A screenshot of the plot (image)\nClaim or Purpose: What the author is trying to say with this plot\nSource: URL, or some other similarly clear description of how to get to the original plot\nEach row is: A short phrase of what each row of the plot dataframe represents (e.g., “The data has one row per day and rider type”.\nData dictionary: A table of (possible) variable names and what they (probably) represent\nData Sources: Potential sources for the data, in the form of URLs or similar. Try downloading and opening the data if you can; report on any anticipated difficulties.\n\nYou don’t have to fill in everything for the initial post; you can come back and fill it in later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe plot you choose to replicate should have at least 3 variables.\nIf you really want to make a plot that has fewer than 3 variables, you should be able to explain why it’s still interesting and worth doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Plot Selection Guidelines\n\n\n\nThe plot you choose to replicate:\n\nShould make an interesting claim.\n\nShouldn’t just be about something (e.g., “number of wins by each athlete”)\nMost interesting claims are about relationships (e.g,. “the highest paid athletes don’t necessarily win more”)\nA claim finishes the sentence: “The article uses this graphic to back up the claim that BLANK”.\nIf the article doesn’t make a claim, make one up. Imagine that you’ve gotten in an argument with someone and you show them this plot to back up your claim; what claim were you trying to make?\n\nShould involve at least 3 variables.\n\nIdeally they have to come from several separate data sources that you have to bring together.\n\nShould have some room for improvement, i.e., you’d be interested in trying a different way of presenting the data.\n\nIf you are really stuck, I can simply assign something to do, but I’m hoping to avoid that.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5: Data\nFind and load the data; write a brief critique of the data.\nFor this milestone, your report should be complete through the “Data” section. See the Report Template below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Selection Guidelines\n\n\n\nThe data you find:\n\nShould come from a reputable source.\n\nIf you use an aggregation site like OurWorldInData, try to track down where they got the data.\n\nShould require at least a little bit of wrangling\n\nBeware of sites where you can download exactly the data for a specific plot\n“Download data for this chart” links are red flags that you may be getting already-wrangled data.\n\n\nSee Some questions to ask if you’re working with data that you didn’t collect yourself.\nIf the wrangling is especially straightforward, you can add depth by:\n\nFinding a different source for the same data\nCritiquing the data collection process\nDescribing alternative choices that could have been made in the data collection or wrangling process and what the consequences of those choices might be.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6: Initial plot and ideas\nMake an initial plot and a todo list of things to improve; sketch ideas for alternative ways to plot the same data.\nYour report should be complete through the “Wrangling” section and have some initial work in the “Replication” and “Alternatives” sections.\n\n\nWeek 8: Presentation and Report\nPresent the original, replication, and alternative plots to the class and in a Quarto report."

You may choose to organize your report differently if you have a good reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to show the Report Template\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"A title\"\nauthor:\n    - \"Your name\"\n    - \"Partner name\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    code-tools: true\n    code-fold: true\n---\n\n```{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n```\n\n```{python}\n#| echo: false\n# Hack to make plotly work in RStudio\nif 'r' in globals() and r['.Platform$GUI'] == \"RStudio\" and r['suppressMessages(requireNamespace(\"htmltools\"))']:\n  r[\".GlobalEnv$to_html &lt;- function(x) { print(htmltools::HTML(x)) }\"] and None\n  def show_plot(p): r.to_html(p._repr_html_())\nelse:\n  def show_plot(p): return p\n```\n\n🚧\nThis template is intended to help you structure your report. Remove placeholders like this and make it your own. Not every question needs to be answered for every project, and some projects will have additional questions. **Your final report should not include any \"under construction\" or template text.**\n\n## Overview\n\n🚧\nWe are interested in TOPIC because STORY. So we chose to replicate a plot from [this article] (INCLUDE THE COMPLETE URL TO THE ARTICLE).\n\n🚧\nOriginal visualization:\n\n![](https://example.com/your-url-here)\n\n🚧\nClaim:\n\n&gt; You can put the claim in a \"block quote\" like this.\n&gt; A concise statement (ideally a quote) of the claim that the article uses the visualization to make (or the claim you invented if there wasn't a clear one)\n\n\n## Design\n\n🚧\nWhat overall type of visualization was chosen? Why might the author have chosen it?\n🚧\nWhat variables are being shown?\n🚧\nWhat visual cues (aka retinal variables or aesthetics) were chosen to represent those data variables?\n🚧\n    For at least one of these variables, describe what makes that choice appropriate or inappropriate.\n🚧\nOverall, what about the visual makes it effective, or ineffective, for making its claim?\n\n\n## Data\n\n### Data Overview\n\n🚧\nWhether you were able to find the original data (if not, why not?)\n🚧\nWhere the data came from\n🚧\n    Direct URL and/or specific instructions for how to obtain it.\n🚧\n    Under what terms is the source allowing you to use the data?\n🚧\n    Try to trace it upstream as close to the source as you can.\n🚧\n    Who worked with the data on its way to you? (Include names and roles, if applicable.)\n🚧\n    What processing may have happened to it: was it aggregated? Anonymized? etc.\n🚧\nWhat might we need to know about the data collection process in order to interpret the data correctly? (e.g., If it’s from a survey–who was surveyed?)\n\n### Data Details\n\n🚧\n```{r load-data}\n# your code to load the data here\n```\n\n🚧\nA low-level description of the size and structure of the data.\n🚧\nHow many rows are there?\nWhat does a single row represent? (Translate the first observation in the dataset into an English sentence.)\n🚧\nWhat might be interesting to know about what information the data does, and doesn’t, provide?\n\n\n### Wrangling\n\n🚧\nDescribe, at a broad level, what you need to do to the data to make it into the form you need for the plot. (e.g., what data types need fixing, whether you need to pivot, what filtering is needed, etc.)\n\n🚧\nAdd code blocks, with appropriate names, for wrangling steps. **Explain the *why* for any choices you make (like filtering data).**\n\n## Replication\n\n🚧\nInclude your replication, along with all code needed.\n🚧\nBriefly describe any difficulties you encountered, both those you overcame and those you still have not. (It’s ok to not have a perfect graph here. If the essential structure is there, don’t worry if the details are a bit different. Focus your attention on making an interesting and polished alternative design.)\n🚧\n\n\n## Alternatives\n\n🚧\nDescribe at least two alternative design choices that could be made in visualizing your data. For each design, include the following sections\n\n### Alternative 1: Design\n\n🚧\nWhat choice did the original visual make? (e.g., to use a particular aesthetic mapping or glyph)\n🚧\nWhat choice does your alternative design make instead? (It should be a reasonable choice, but it doesn’t have to be an improvement.)\n🚧\nHow does that change affect how the visual supports the original claim? Can your redesign now support some different claim?\n\n### Implementation\n\n🚧\nMake a solid attempt to implement your best alternative design.\nIf creating it using plotly is too challenging, you may include a high-fidelity sketch of what the plot would look like (using PowerPoint, a vector graphics tool, or a good-quality scan of a paper or whiteboard), along with a clear description of what you’d need to figure out in order to produce it with code.\n\n## Summary\n\n🚧\nNow that you’ve gone through the whole process, how has your understanding of, and belief in, the original article’s claim changed?\n🚧\nHow faithful was your replication?\n🚧\nCompare your original and alternative designs. Which is best for what purpose?\n🚧\nWhat follow-up questions and ideas do you have about the data or visualization you worked with?\n🚧\nHow do you feel about this whole experience?\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n🚧\nInclude the full names of any students outside your team who helped you and a brief description of how they helped.\n\n### License\n\nSharing: Would you be okay with sharing your project, and if so, how?\n\nIdeally we'd make a public gallery with all projects, screenshots, and code, but you could choose to:\n\n- Go anonymous (choices: \"anon\" or \"names\")\n- Don't share code? (choices: \"code\" or \"screenshots\" or \"just title\")\n- Restrict to just future students (choices: \"public\" or \"students\").\n\nso, e.g., you might say \"anon, code, students\" or \"names, screenshots, public\".\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Style\nYour report should be:\n\nunderstandable by itself: a reader should not need to see your discussion posts or prior submissions.\nreproducible – if a new version of the data becomes available, anyone should be able to re-run your code and get an updated plot. Things to avoid:\n\npaths that only work on your computer\nmaking modifications to your raw data (e.g., editing it in Excel)\nhard-coding row numbers or other things that are likely to change\n\nunderstandable without the code: a reader should be able to skip over all of the code and understand all of the results.\nAt least one of your visuals (either the original or alternative design) should be high quality, with effort spent getting the details right.\nClean up any messy outputs from code (debugging, etc.)\nWrite succinctly. Bulleted lists are fine when they’re clear.\nUse ordinary text formatting (not headings, blockquotes, etc.) for ordinary prose. Reserve headings and block quotes for headings and quotes.\nFormat your code cleanly. If lazy, select the code and click “Reformat Code” on the Code menu. (Make sure you save first.)\nRead through the report before submitting. Check that you don’t have placeholder text, the headings make sense, etc.\n\nAcademic Integrity: If you take any code from elsewhere, you must state very clearly where it came from and how you changed it. This includes ChatGPT and other AI tools. If you find a plot and it has Plotly code already, I advise against looking at it, and possibly even finding a different plot. Code using a different toolkit (e.g., R) is probably okay.\n\n\nPresentation\nTo practice making data-driven arguments, this project includes a brief presentation, done on VoiceThread.\nKeep it short and simple. The slides should be as follows:\n\nOriginal Plot and Claim\nData (where’d you get it, anything interesting about it or what you had to do with it)\nReplication\nAlternative 1: what did you change? why?\nAlternative 2: (same)\nSummary: one or two take-aways\n\nUse a presentation tool like Google Slides or PowerPoint.\nUse voice comments to narrate. Each team member should make at least one comment."

Trace where it came from and how it’s structured. Load it and process it using the data science toolkit we’re studying to a form that’s appropriate for making the visualization.\nVisualization: Replicate (re-create) a visualization that someone else already made based on that data.

What sort of stories does the chosen visualization amplify?\nStory: Consider the story that the original source told using the visualization. Is that story accurate? complete? clearly articulated? How did choices in the data collection, preparation, and visualization affect the storytelling? Are there other stories that the data might also be telling?\n\nThis project addresses our course-level learning objectives in this way:\n\nTechnical skills: manipulating data, constructing visualizations, and creating reports.\nCommunication: analyzing choices made in visualization and text with respect to how it tells a story about data. Proposing and implementing changes to improve the clarity of communication.\nEthics and Critical Thinking: identify potential ethical questions (e.g., of transparency, diversity, etc.) that emerge in the process of obtaining, manipulating, and communicating with data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The goal of this project is to practice a complete data science workflow: question, data, exploration, modeling, and communication. Results will be presented as a report, supporting code, and a brief presentation to the class. Successful outcomes should include visual, analytical, and perspectival components. The report should be at the level of polish and formality of a blog post (more than a class homework assignment, less than an academic paper). The overview and primary visualizations should be intelligible to a non-technical audience; the methods should be described in precise technical language as appropriate.\nAn important component of this project is a comparative critique of some related prior work. That is, you are not simply demonstrating that you can perform an analysis, but also that you can evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of others’ analyses. This may be the most important take-away from this class for your future career.\n\n\nTeams: Both individual and team projects are permitted, with a mild encouragement towards teams.\nPresentations: The final course meeting (during the designated final exam period) will be devoted to final project presentations. Feedback on others’ projects will be part of your final project grade, so attendance is mandatory.\nThere are two sections of this class, thus two sessions of final project presentations. Refer to the Calvin exam schedule for the official dates; for 2023, it’s Saturday Dec. 9 at 1:30 p.m. and Monday Dec. 11 at 1:30 p.m.. Your team must choose which to present at. You are welcome to attend both sessions to see everyone’s work.\n\n\n\n\nNov 11: Initial proposal. This should include:\n\nA tentative topic (kind of data you want to work with, question you’d like to ask). Include a brief description of what drives your interest in it.\nAn example or two of some data science work you’ve found on the topic already. See below for some guidance on this. Include the URLs of resources you found, and some brief commentary about each one (does it seem good?)\nA proposal of what you’d like to do. A first step will usually be to do an analysis similar to one of the examples you found, and you may not have much idea beyond that at this time. But if you do have some ideas for what you might want to do differently, this is a good place to include them. Note that your overall task should include some modeling (predictive or otherwise).\nTentative Teams: If you have already found people who may be interested in working with you, note that here.\n\nNov 18: Dataset, exploratory visualization, and summary of prior work\n\nYou should have the EDA section of your report complete, and a good start on everything before that.\n\nDec 2: Initial modeling and visualization\nDec 12: Final report\n\n\n\n\nYou can find examples of data science work on sites like Kaggle, TowardsDataScience, Reddit, YouTube, and GitHub. Also check out the TidyTuesday project and r-bloggers.\nYour project should include some modeling, so it should involve more than making visualizations. Predictive modeling is closest to the emphasis of this class, but other kinds of modeling (such as clustering) are often ok.\nYour data should be rich enough to support the kind of modeling you want to do, but not too complex to work with. For example, avoid any dataset larger than 500 MB since it probably won’t fit. Also, avoid image and sound data for similar reasons. (Although if you really want to work with images, there are ways to do this.)\nSome types of projects that have worked well in the past:\n\nParticipating in a Kaggle competition. It should be a competition that is still open. You don’t need to win, but you should be able to do better than the baseline. You should also do some EDA and/or visualization beyond what’s already been done by others.\nReproducing a published analysis. Find a published analysis that you can reproduce, and then extend it in some way. For example, you might find a published analysis that uses a dataset you can’t access, and then find a similar dataset that you can access. Or you might find a published analysis that uses a dataset you can access, and then extend it in some way (e.g., by adding a new feature, or by using a different model).\n\nSome projects that could work great, but should be discussed with the instructor first:\n\nRedoing some class activities using a different toolkit. For example, what if this class were to be taught in JavaScript using ObservableHQ? (Talk with Prof Arnold for detailed ideas.)\nExploring interpretable models. There are some new types of models coming out that are more interpretable, but we have not gotten to discuss them much in class. Perhaps you could explore one of these models and compare it to a more traditional model.\nWorking with a large language model. For example, could you give ChatGPT some example rows from your dataset, then ask it to write a decision tree for you, and evaluate the result? There are losts of\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nYou will likely need to make some choices regarding what variables to include, whether to do some pre-processing (e.g., addressing missing values, generating new variables), etc. Clearly state:\n\nWhat decisions you made\nWhy you made them\nWhat might have been alternative choices.\n\nTell the “rational reconstruction” of the story of how the analysis was done.\n\nDon’t give the play-by-play of everything you tried, every idea you had, etc., but…\nDo include things you tried that led to an important observation later on.\n\nIf you use any code from the Internet, you should acknowledge its source and provide a link.\nYou should submit all of the code needed to replicate your results, but your report should be understandable without looking at the code.\nHere is a template (rendered) that gives one possible outline. You may adapt the outline as needed for your project.\nYou’ll submit both slides and a report. See the Midterm project for submission instructions.\n\nYour report should include the following general elements (though treat this specific outline as a suggestion only; certain reports will need to deviate from this structure in small or large part):\n\nA succinct but descriptive title\nOverview\n\nA real-world question that you’d like to explore, and why it’s interesting.\n\nThis question should be stated in language that is understandable to someone who hasn’t studied data science and doesn’t know the details of your dataset.\nThe best questions include motivation from prior literature that gives, for example, some pattern or relationship that you’d expect to find and why.\n\nA brief (2-4 sentences) high-level description of the dataset: what is the dataset about? Where did it come from? What sort of data does it contain?\n\nPrior Work\n\nA summary of what you have found that others have done with your data or question. Include URLs and author names.\nA response to their work:\n\nWhat did they do well that is inspiring?\nWhat could they improve on or explore further?\nDo you trust their results? Why or why not?\n\nIn what ways do you intend for this project to extend or enhance that prior work? (Save the details of how for the Approach section.)\n\nApproach\n\nA problem description or specific question\n\nThis question should be stated in more specific technical terms than the real-world question.\nIt should reference the particular features of your dataset.\nThis question ideally helps answer the real-world question, but it’s okay if it doesn’t.\n\nThe approach that you’ll take to answer that question, probably using some sort of predictive or statistical modeling.\nA description of the data’s provenance: as much as you can, trace the path from the events or measurements all the way to the dataset you’re working with. You might answer:\n\nwhere did the data come from originally?\nWhere did you download it from? As much as you can tell or speculate, how did it end up available there?\n\nThe number of records (rows) in the dataset, and what each one represents.\n\nGive an example of some part of the data in your dataset.\nConsider writing a simple sentence that conveys the information in the first row, as an example.\n\nA list of the features in the dataset and their types.\nAn analysis of the appropriateness of your dataset for your approach. (What’s good about it? What do you wish were better?)\nThis section should also discuss the overall approach of any basic data wrangling needed to get the data into an overall usable form. More specific wrangling may be needed for constructing plots or models later.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nShow plots or tables illustrating the distribution of at least two variables in your dataset. Comment on anything interesting you observe.\nShow plots illustrating bivariate relationships for at least 2 pairs of variables. Comment on anything interesting you observe (e.g., strength of relationship, dependence on other factors).\nSummarize your EDA findings: how do your observations inform the modeling?\n\nModeling\n\nThis section is written for predictive modeling; if you’re doing inferential modeling or clustering, adapt this section as needed.\nDescribe the modeling setup. Clearly state at least:\n\nwhat is the target variable you are trying to predict\nwhich variables (features) you are using to predict it, and why you chose those features\nhow you will measure accuracy (can you give meaningful units?)\nwhat validation method did you choose and why\n\nFit a basic predictive model using one of the techniques we discussed in class (e.g., Decision Trees, Linear/Logistic Regression, Random Forest)\n\nDescribe why you chose that model (and its features and any hyperparameters)\nDescribe what kind of performance you expect from it\n\nReport the results of your basic predictive model via cross-validation.\nMake one or more changes to the predictive model to (attempt to) improve the accuracy. Discuss what changes you made, why you made them, and what the results were.\nThe strongest reports will include insightful visualizations of the model, its predictions, and/or its mistakes, and a discussion of what those plots tell us.\nReport on the final accuracy of your best model on the test set, if applicable.\nAlternative: instead of a supervised prediction task, you can define an unsupervised learning task and use clustering. In this case, clearly state what you want to understand through the clustering, and report your observations.\n\nFindings: Summarize the analyses you performed and what the results told you. What do your findings say about the real-world and prediction (or clustering) questions you posed?\nLimitations: What are some limitations of your analyses? Did you notice any potential biases in the data you used or analysis you did? Any other ethical questions raised during this project?\nFuture Directions: What new questions came up following your exploration of this data? Identify at least one question that would require new data or a new analysis approach, and specify what steps would be required.\n\nYou might additionally walk through what the model predicts, and how it does it, for one or two specific examples, ideally ones that aren’t even part of your dataset.\n(Project descriptions originally thanks to Ofra Amir)"

    "title": "Final Project",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The goal of this project is to practice a complete data science workflow: question, data, exploration, modeling, and communication. Results will be presented as a report, supporting code, and a brief presentation to the class. Successful outcomes should include visual, analytical, and perspectival components. The report should be at the level of polish and formality of a blog post (more than a class homework assignment, less than an academic paper). The overview and primary visualizations should be intelligible to a non-technical audience; the methods should be described in precise technical language as appropriate.\nAn important component of this project is a comparative critique of some related prior work. That is, you are not simply demonstrating that you can perform an analysis, but also that you can evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of others’ analyses. This may be the most important take-away from this class for your future career.\n\n\nTeams: Both individual and team projects are permitted, with a mild encouragement towards teams.\nPresentations: The final course meeting (during the designated final exam period) will be devoted to final project presentations. Feedback on others’ projects will be part of your final project grade, so attendance is mandatory.\nThere are two sections of this class, thus two sessions of final project presentations. Refer to the Calvin exam schedule for the official dates; for 2023, it’s Saturday Dec. 9 at 1:30 p.m. and Monday Dec. 11 at 1:30 p.m.. Your team must choose which to present at. You are welcome to attend both sessions to see everyone’s work.\n\n\n\n\nNov 11: Initial proposal. This should include:\n\nA tentative topic (kind of data you want to work with, question you’d like to ask). Include a brief description of what drives your interest in it.\nAn example or two of some data science work you’ve found on the topic already. See below for some guidance on this. Include the URLs of resources you found, and some brief commentary about each one (does it seem good?)\nA proposal of what you’d like to do. A first step will usually be to do an analysis similar to one of the examples you found, and you may not have much idea beyond that at this time. But if you do have some ideas for what you might want to do differently, this is a good place to include them. Note that your overall task should include some modeling (predictive or otherwise).\nTentative Teams: If you have already found people who may be interested in working with you, note that here.\n\nNov 18: Dataset, exploratory visualization, and summary of prior work\n\nYou should have the EDA section of your report complete, and a good start on everything before that.\n\nDec 2: Initial modeling and visualization\nDec 12: Final report\n\n\n\n\nYou can find examples of data science work on sites like Kaggle, TowardsDataScience, Reddit, YouTube, and GitHub. Also check out the TidyTuesday project and r-bloggers.\nYour project should include some modeling, so it should involve more than making visualizations. Predictive modeling is closest to the emphasis of this class, but other kinds of modeling (such as clustering) are often ok.\nYour data should be rich enough to support the kind of modeling you want to do, but not too complex to work with. For example, avoid any dataset larger than 500 MB since it probably won’t fit. Also, avoid image and sound data for similar reasons. (Although if you really want to work with images, there are ways to do this.)\nSome types of projects that have worked well in the past:\n\nParticipating in a Kaggle competition. It should be a competition that is still open. You don’t need to win, but you should be able to do better than the baseline. You should also do some EDA and/or visualization beyond what’s already been done by others.\nReproducing a published analysis. Find a published analysis that you can reproduce, and then extend it in some way. For example, you might find a published analysis that uses a dataset you can’t access, and then find a similar dataset that you can access. Or you might find a published analysis that uses a dataset you can access, and then extend it in some way (e.g., by adding a new feature, or by using a different model).\n\nSome projects that could work great, but should be discussed with the instructor first:\n\nRedoing some class activities using a different toolkit. For example, what if this class were to be taught in JavaScript using ObservableHQ? (Talk with Prof Arnold for detailed ideas.)\nExploring interpretable models. There are some new types of models coming out that are more interpretable, but we have not gotten to discuss them much in class. Perhaps you could explore one of these models and compare it to a more traditional model.\nWorking with a large language model. For example, could you give ChatGPT some example rows from your dataset, then ask it to write a decision tree for you, and evaluate the result? There are losts of\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nYou will likely need to make some choices regarding what variables to include, whether to do some pre-processing (e.g., addressing missing values, generating new variables), etc. Clearly state:\n\nWhat decisions you made\nWhy you made them\nWhat might have been alternative choices.\n\nTell the “rational reconstruction” of the story of how the analysis was done.\n\nDon’t give the play-by-play of everything you tried, every idea you had, etc., but…\nDo include things you tried that led to an important observation later on.\n\nIf you use any code from the Internet, you should acknowledge its source and provide a link.\nYou should submit all of the code needed to replicate your results, but your report should be understandable without looking at the code.\nHere is a template (rendered) that gives one possible outline. You may adapt the outline as needed for your project.\nYou’ll submit both slides and a report. See the Midterm project for submission instructions.\n\nYour report should include the following general elements (though treat this specific outline as a suggestion only; certain reports will need to deviate from this structure in small or large part):\n\nA succinct but descriptive title\nOverview\n\nA real-world question that you’d like to explore, and why it’s interesting.\n\nThis question should be stated in language that is understandable to someone who hasn’t studied data science and doesn’t know the details of your dataset.\nThe best questions include motivation from prior literature that gives, for example, some pattern or relationship that you’d expect to find and why.\n\nA brief (2-4 sentences) high-level description of the dataset: what is the dataset about? Where did it come from? What sort of data does it contain?\n\nPrior Work\n\nA summary of what you have found that others have done with your data or question. Include URLs and author names.\nA response to their work:\n\nWhat did they do well that is inspiring?\nWhat could they improve on or explore further?\nDo you trust their results? Why or why not?\n\nIn what ways do you intend for this project to extend or enhance that prior work? (Save the details of how for the Approach section.)\n\nApproach\n\nA problem description or specific question\n\nThis question should be stated in more specific technical terms than the real-world question.\nIt should reference the particular features of your dataset.\nThis question ideally helps answer the real-world question, but it’s okay if it doesn’t.\n\nThe approach that you’ll take to answer that question, probably using some sort of predictive or statistical modeling.\nA description of the data’s provenance: as much as you can, trace the path from the events or measurements all the way to the dataset you’re working with.
