Let's retrieve what we learned last time:

---

- Load the CSV file (`student-mat.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame named `students`.

---

- Select and display the data for the student at index 5.

---

- Select and display the G3 column (final grade) for all students.

---

- Create a new column named `total_grade` which is the sum of G1 and G2 and display the first few rows.

---

- Sort the DataFrame by age in ascending order and display the first few rows.

---

- Calculate and display the mean of the G3 column (final grade).
