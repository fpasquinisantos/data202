You will submit a single report and make a joint presentation.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Depth Somewhere\"}\nThis document details various requirements for the project. Not all requirements will make sense for every project, though. \n\nThe overall goal is that your project has depth *somewhere*. For example, you may choose to go deeper in:\n\n- understanding where the data came from\n- wrangling the data\n- analyzing the visualization and designing alternatives\n- thinking deeply about who the audience of the visualization is and making well-motivated design choices\n- making a high-quality plot\n\nGoing deeper in one area may mean that you don't go as deep in another area. For example, if the data wrangling is very difficult, we will have lower expectations for other parts of the project.\n\nIf you're unsure whether a specific requirement applies to your project, ask.\n:::\n\n\n## 1: Plot selection and initial analysis (Week 4)\n\nUpload a screenshot of one or more potential plots to the Plot Gallery.

See the [Report Template](#report-template) below.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Data Selection Guidelines\"}\n\nThe data you find:\n\n- Should come from a reputable source.\n  - If you use an aggregation site like [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/), try to track down where *they* got the data.\n- Should require at least a little bit of wrangling\n  - *Beware* of sites where you can download *exactly* the data for a specific plot\n  - \"Download data for this chart\" links are red flags that you may be getting already-wrangled data.\n\nSee [Some questions to ask if you're working with data that you didn't collect yourself](http://bit.ly/quaesita_notyours).\n\nIf the wrangling is especially straightforward, you can add depth by:\n\n- Finding a different source for the same data\n- Critiquing the data collection process\n- Describing alternative choices that could have been made in the data collection or wrangling process and what the consequences of those choices might be.\n\n:::\n\n## 3: Initial plot and ideas (Week 6)\n\nMake an initial plot and a todo list of things to improve; sketch ideas for alternative ways to plot the same data.\n\nYour report should be complete through the \"Wrangling\" section and have some initial work in the \"Replication\" and \"Alternatives\" sections.\n\n## 4: Presentation and Report (Week 8)\n\nPresent the original, replication, and alternative plots in a video and in a iPython Notebook (Google Colab, etc) report.\n\n\n# Report and Presentation Details\n\n## Report Content\n\nYour report should include the following sections:\n\n- **Overview** of the original plot (include a screenshot) and the claim it makes.\n- **Design** of the original plot. (plot type, effectiveness)\n- **Data** (where'd you get it, anything interesting about it or what you had to do with it)\n- **Wrangling** (what did you have to do to get it into a form that you could plot?)\n- **Replication** (show your replication of the original plot)\n- **Alternative 1**: what did you change? why?\n- **Alternative 2**: (same, but can be a sketch rather than a full plot)\n- **Summary**: one or two take-aways\n\n## Report Template\n\nThis template includes a suggested outline for your report. You may choose to organize your report differently if you have a good reason.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Click to show the Report Template\"}\n\n```{python}\n#| echo: false\n#| output: asis\nprint(\"`````python\")\nprint(open('midterm-proj-template.qmd').read())\nprint((\"`````\"))\n```\n\n:::\n\n## Report Style\n\nYour report should be:\n\n- *understandable by itself*: a reader should not need to see your discussion posts or prior submissions.\n- *reproducible* -- if a new version of the data becomes available, anyone should be able to re-run your code and get an updated plot. Things to avoid:\n  - paths that only work on your computer\n  - making modifications to your raw data (e.g., editing it in Excel)\n  - hard-coding row numbers or other things that are likely to change\n- *understandable without the code*: a reader should be able to skip over all of the code and understand all of the results.\n- At least one of your visuals (either the original or alternative design) should be high quality, with effort spent getting the details right.\n- Clean up any messy outputs from code (debugging, etc.)\n- Write succinctly. Bulleted lists are fine when they're clear.\n- Use ordinary text formatting (not headings, blockquotes, etc.) for ordinary prose. Reserve headings and block quotes for headings and quotes.\n- Format your code cleanly. If lazy, select the code and click \"Reformat Code\" on the Code menu. (Make sure you save first.)\n- Read through the report before submitting. Check that you don't have placeholder text, the headings make sense, etc.\n\n**Academic Integrity**: If you take any code from elsewhere, you **must** state very clearly where it came from and how you changed it. This includes ChatGPT and other AI tools. If you find a plot and it has Plotly code already, I advise against looking at it, and possibly even finding a different plot. Code using a different toolkit (e.g., R) is probably okay.\n\n## Presentation\n\nTo practice making data-driven arguments, this project includes a brief presentation, done on VoiceThread.\n\nKeep it short and simple. The slides should be as follows:\n\n1. Original Plot and Claim\n2. Data (where'd you get it, anything interesting about it or what you had to do with it)\n3. Replication\n4. Alternative 1: what did you change? why?\n5. Alternative 2: (same)\n6. Summary: one or two take-aways\n\nUse a presentation tool like Google Slides or PowerPoint.\n\nUse voice comments to narrate. Each team member should make at least one comment.\n\n# Report Submission\n\n- If your dataset is *less than 10 MB*: submit a **`.zip` file** with your entire project folder.\n- Otherwise: submit just the HTML (and make sure the instructions are *very clear* about how to get the data)\n  - Use the header from the template, which includes these important settings:\n    - Keep `code-tools: true` in the header so we can see your source code.\n    - Make sure you keep `embed-resources: true` so we can see any images.  \n\n# Checklist\n\nThe following is the minimal requirements for the project. The project should also go into depth in some area.\n\n- Overview\n  - [ ] Includes a screenshot of the original plot\n  - [ ] Includes a description of the claim made by the original plot (or the claim you're making if the original doesn't make a claim)\n  - [ ] Includes a link to the original plot\n- Design\n  - [ ] Names the type of the original plot (scatter, bar, etc.)\n  - [ ] Identifies the variables used in the original plot\n  - [ ] Identifies the visual cue that each variable is mapped to.\n  - [ ] Discusses the effectiveness of the original plot\n- Data\n  - [ ] Identifies the source of the data used for the replication (including a link if possible)\n  - [ ] Indicates how many rows and columns are in the data (e.g., \"the data has 100 rows and 5 columns\")\n  - [ ] Describes what a single row represents (e.g., \"one row per day per rider type\")\n  - [ ] Describes the variables in the data (e.g., \"the data has columns for date, rider type, and number of rides\")\n- Wrangling\n  - [ ] Describes the overall process of wrangling the data (e.g., \"I had to combine data from sources X and Y, then filter out rows that aren't Z, then calculate the average number of rides per day\")\n  - [ ] Includes code blocks that show the wrangling process\n  - [ ] Gives an example of the data after wrangling (e.g., the `.head()` and the `.info()`)\n- Replication\n  - [ ] Includes the replication of the original plot\n  - [ ] Replication has the same general type of plot as the original (can be different in unimportant details like specific colors used, extra annonatiotns, etc.)\n  - [ ] Replication has the same general variables as the original, mapped to the same general visual cues\n  - [ ] Describes any difficulties encountered in the replication process\n  - [ ] Describes any relevant differences between the original and replication\n- Alternatives\n  - [ ] Includes textual descriptions of two alternative ways to plot the same data that are different in a substantive way (e.g., not just a different color scheme) from each other and from the original plot.\n  - [ ] Includes images of both alternatives.

Trace where it came from and how it's structured. Load it and process it *using the data science toolkit we're studying* to a form that's appropriate for making the visualization.\n* **Visualization**: Replicate (re-create) a visualization that someone else already made based on that data. Evaluate some of the choices and assumptions that were made in the visualization process: in what ways does the visualization faithfully represent the data (or not)? What sort of stories does the chosen visualization amplify?\n* **Story**: Consider the story that the original source told using the visualization. Is that story accurate? complete? clearly articulated? How did choices in the data collection, preparation, and visualization affect the storytelling? Are there other stories that the data might also be telling?\n\nThis project addresses our course-level learning objectives in this way:\n\n* **Technical skills**: manipulating data, constructing visualizations, and creating reports.\n* **Communication**: analyzing choices made in visualization and text with respect to how it tells a story about data. Proposing and implementing changes to improve the clarity of communication.\n* **Ethics and Critical Thinking**: identify potential ethical questions (e.g., of transparency, diversity, etc.) that emerge in the process of obtaining, manipulating, and communicating with data.\n\n<!--\n## Grading Guide\n\n\nOverall\n\n- Data\n  - Wrangling (20)\n  - Discussion (15)\n- Visualization\n  - Analysis (15)\n  - Quality (20)\n  - Alternatives (20)\n- Report\n  - legibility (5)\n  - reproducibility (5)\n-->","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n**Replicate and critique a visual**.\n\nFor this project you will pick some existing data science work (a newspapar article, blog post, report, research paper, etc.) and replicate a visual from it using the data wrangling and plotting tools we're studying.\n\nYou will then critique the original visualization and propose alternative designs.\n\nThe project will be done in teams of between 1 and 3.
