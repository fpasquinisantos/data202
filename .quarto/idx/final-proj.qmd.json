{"title":"Final Project","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Final Project"},"headingText":"**Final Project**: A complete Data Science process","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n\n![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/diagrams/data-science/base.png)\n\nThe goal of this project is to practice a complete data science workflow: question, data, exploration, modeling, and communication.\nResults will be presented as a report, supporting code, and a brief presentation to the class. Successful outcomes should include visual, analytical, and perspectival components. The report should be at the level of polish and formality of a blog post (more than a class homework assignment, less than an academic paper). The overview and primary visualizations should be intelligible to a non-technical audience; the methods should be described in precise technical language as appropriate.\n\nAn important component of this project is a *comparative critique* of some related prior work. That is, you are not simply demonstrating that you can perform an analysis, but also that you can evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of others' analyses. This may be the most important take-away from this class for your future career.\n\n### Logistics\n\n**Teams**: Both individual and team projects are permitted, with a mild encouragement towards teams.\n\n**Presentations**: The final course meeting (during the designated final exam period) will be devoted to final project presentations. Feedback on others' projects will be part of your final project grade, so attendance is mandatory.\n\nThere are two sections of this class, thus two sessions of final project presentations. Refer to the [Calvin exam schedule](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/center-for-student-success/registration/exam-schedule/) for the official dates; for 2023, it's Saturday Dec. 9 at 1:30 p.m. and Monday Dec. 11 at 1:30 p.m.. Your team must choose which to present at. You are welcome to attend both sessions to see everyone's work.\n\n### Milestones\n\n* Nov 11: **Initial proposal**. This should include:\n  * A tentative *topic* (kind of data you want to work with, question you'd like to ask). Include a brief description of what drives your interest in it.\n  * An *example* or two of some data science work you've found on the topic already. See below for some guidance on this. Include the URLs of resources you found, and some brief commentary about each one (does it seem good?)\n  * A proposal of *what you'd like to do*. A first step will usually be to do an analysis similar to one of the examples you found, and you may not have much idea beyond that at this time. But if you do have some ideas for what you might want to do differently, this is a good place to include them. Note that your overall task should include some modeling (predictive or otherwise).\n  * Tentative *Teams*: If you have already found people who may be interested in working with you, note that here.\n* Nov 18: **Dataset, exploratory visualization, and summary of prior work**\n  - You should have the EDA section of your report complete, and a good start on everything before that.\n* Dec 2: **Initial modeling and visualization**\n* Dec 12: **Final report**\n\n### Choosing a project and examples\n\nYou can find examples of data science work on sites like Kaggle, TowardsDataScience, Reddit, YouTube, and GitHub. Also check out the TidyTuesday project and r-bloggers.\n\nYour project should include some modeling, so it should involve more than making visualizations.\nPredictive modeling is closest to the emphasis of this class, but other kinds of modeling (such as clustering) are often ok.\n\nYour data should be rich enough to support the kind of modeling you want to do, but not too complex to work with.\nFor example, avoid any dataset larger than 500 MB since it probably won't fit.\nAlso, avoid image and sound data for similar reasons. (Although if you really want to work with images, there are ways to do this.)\n\nSome types of projects that have worked well in the past:\n\n- **Participating in a Kaggle competition**. It should be a competition that is still open. You don't need to win, but you should be able to do better than the baseline. You should also do some EDA and/or visualization beyond what's already been done by others.\n- **Reproducing a published analysis**. Find a published analysis that you can reproduce, and then extend it in some way. For example, you might find a published analysis that uses a dataset you can't access, and then find a similar dataset that you can access. Or you might find a published analysis that uses a dataset you can access, and then extend it in some way (e.g., by adding a new feature, or by using a different model).\n\nSome projects that could work great, but should be discussed with the instructor first:\n\n- **Redoing some class activities using a different toolkit**. For example, what if this class were to be taught in JavaScript using [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/)? (Talk with Prof Arnold for detailed ideas.)\n- **Exploring interpretable models**. There are some new types of models coming out that are more interpretable, but we have not gotten to discuss them much in class. Perhaps you could explore one of these models and compare it to a more traditional model.\n- **Working with a large language model**. For example, could you give ChatGPT some example rows from your dataset, then ask it to write a decision tree for you, and evaluate the result? There are losts of \n\n---\n\n\n### Detailed Expectations\n\n**NOTES**:\n\n* You will likely need to make some choices regarding what variables to include, whether to do some pre-processing (e.g., addressing missing values, generating new variables), etc. Clearly state:\n  * **What** decisions you made\n  * **Why** you made them\n  * What might have been *alternative* choices.\n* Tell the \"**[rational reconstruction](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/readings/shieber-writing.pdf)**\" of the story of how the analysis was done.\n  * **Don't** give the play-by-play of everything you tried, every idea you had, etc., but...\n  * **Do** include things you tried that led to an important observation later on.\n* If you use any code from the Internet, you should acknowledge its source and provide a link.\n* You should submit all of the code needed to replicate your results, but **your report should be understandable without looking at the code**.\n* Here is a [template](project/final_proj.Rmd) ([rendered](project/final_proj.html)) that gives one possible outline. You may adapt the outline as needed for your project.\n* You'll submit both slides and a report. See the Midterm project for submission instructions.\n\nYour report should include the following general elements (though treat this specific outline as a suggestion only; certain reports will need to deviate from this structure in small or large part):\n\n* A succinct but descriptive **title**\n* **Overview**\n  * A **real-world question** that you'd like to explore, and *why* it's interesting.\n    * This question should be stated in language that is understandable to someone who hasn't studied data science and doesn't know the details of your dataset.\n    * The best questions include motivation from prior literature that gives, for example, some pattern or relationship that you'd *expect* to find and why.\n  * A brief (2-4 sentences) high-level description of the dataset: what is the dataset about? Where did it come from? What sort of data does it contain?\n* **Prior Work**\n  * A summary of what you have found that others have done with your data or question. Include URLs and author names.\n  * A response to their work:\n    * What did they do well that is inspiring?\n    * What could they improve on or explore further?\n    * Do you trust their results? Why or why not?\n  * In what ways do you intend for this project to extend or enhance that prior work? (Save the details of *how* for the Approach section.)\n* **Approach**\n  * A **problem description** or **specific question**\n    * This question should be stated in more specific technical terms than the real-world question.\n    * It should reference the particular features of your dataset.\n    * This question ideally helps answer the real-world question, but it's okay if it doesn't.\n  * The **approach** that you'll take to answer that question, probably using some sort of predictive or statistical modeling.\n  * A description of the data's *provenance*: as much as you can, trace the path from the *events* or *measurements* all the way to the dataset you're working with. You might answer:\n    * where did the data come from originally?\n    * Where did you download it from? As much as you can tell or speculate, how did it end up available there?\n  * The number of records (rows) in the dataset, and what each one represents.\n    * Give an example of some part of the data in your dataset.\n    * Consider writing a simple sentence that conveys the information in the first row, as an example.\n  * A list of the features in the dataset and their types.\n  * An analysis of the **appropriateness of your dataset** for your approach. (What's good about it? What do you wish were better?)\n  * *This section should also discuss the overall approach of any basic data wrangling needed to get the data into an overall usable form. More specific wrangling may be needed for constructing plots or models later.*\n* **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA)\n  * Show plots or tables illustrating the *distribution* of at least two variables in your dataset. Comment on anything interesting you observe.\n  * Show plots illustrating bivariate relationships for at least 2 pairs of variables. Comment on anything interesting you observe (e.g., strength of relationship, dependence on other factors).\n  * Summarize your EDA findings: how do your observations inform the modeling?\n* **Modeling**\n  * *This section is written for predictive modeling; if you're doing inferential modeling or clustering, adapt this section as needed.*\n  * Describe the **modeling setup**. Clearly state at least:\n    * what is the target variable you are trying to predict\n    * which variables (features) you are using to predict it, and why you chose those features\n    * how you will measure accuracy (can you give meaningful units?)\n    * what validation method did you choose and why\n  * Fit a basic predictive model using one of the techniques we discussed in class (e.g., Decision Trees, Linear/Logistic Regression, Random Forest)\n    * Describe why you chose that model (and its features and any hyperparameters)\n    * Describe what kind of performance you expect from it\n  * Report the results of your basic predictive model via cross-validation.\n  * Make one or more changes to the predictive model to (attempt to) improve the accuracy. Discuss what changes you made, why you made them, and what the results were.\n  * The strongest reports will include insightful visualizations of the model, its predictions, and/or its mistakes, and a discussion of what those plots tell us.\n  * Report on the final accuracy of your best model on the test set, if applicable.\n  * **Alternative**: instead of a supervised prediction task, you can define an unsupervised learning task and use clustering. In this case, clearly state what you want to understand through the clustering, and report your observations.\n* **Findings**: Summarize the analyses you performed and what the results told you. What do your findings say about the real-world and prediction (or clustering) questions you posed?\n* **Limitations**: What are some limitations of your analyses? Did you notice any  potential biases in the data you used or analysis you did? Any other ethical questions raised during this project?\n* **Future Directions**: What new questions came up following your exploration of this data? Identify at least one question that would require new data or a new analysis approach, and specify what steps would be required.\n\nYou might additionally walk through what the model predicts, and how it does it, for one or two specific examples, ideally ones that aren't even part of your dataset.\n\n(Project descriptions originally thanks to [Ofra Amir](https://scholar.harvard.edu/oamir/home))\n\n<!-- #### Connection to Learning Objectives -->\n\n<!-- Projects should demonstrate proficiency in the primary learning outcomes of this course: -->\n\n<!-- | Learning outcome | Evidence in project | -->\n<!-- | ---- | ----- | -->\n<!-- | **Formulate** a question or problem that can be answered by data | Includes a statement of the goal of the project that clearly shows what a successful outcome looks like (e.g., how does the work answer the question?
