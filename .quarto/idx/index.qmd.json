We will not accept work that is more than one week late unless you talk to us about the circumstances and negotiate a late-submission plan. We will generally grant up to 30% for these negotiated plans. We will also grant you 4 grace days with no penalty, no questions asked. Please note that grace days do not apply to the quizzes or the final project, and that we do not accept or negotiate for late work after the last day of class. If there are exceptional circumstances, please talk to us so we can work something out.\n\n# Grading\n\nUnless otherwise arranged, grades will be weighted as follows:\n\n-   Quizzes (6): 30%\n-   Projects: 35%\n    -   Midterm project: 10%\n    -   Final project: 25%\n-   Practice exercises: 25%\n-   Discussion forums: 10%\n\nYour lowest quiz score will get thrown out.\n\nLate work will be accepted without penalty if you make prior arrangements or present documentation of a hardship. No late work will be accepted after Reading Recess.\n\nChanges to this policy may be made at the instructor's discretion.\n\n# Academic Integrity\n\nAs the [Calvin Academic Integrity Policy](https://calvin.edu/directory/policies/academic-integrity-policy) says, \"At Calvin, the student-faculty relationship is based on trust and mutual respect.\"\n\nData science is a fundamentally collaborative endeavor. Collaboration brings the benefits of multiple perspectives, needed to tackle complex problems faithfully and responsibly. But teamwork also brings the risk of one person doing all of the \"learning\" for the other. Thus:\n\n-   *Collaboration on homework and labs is encouraged*. For integrity, humility, and gratitude, you should acknowledge any help you receive by name in your submission.\n    -   Even if you work side by side with someone, *submissions should be your own words and code*.\n    -   *Exception*: Some assignments will be pair or team work. The assignment will indicate which.\n    -   It is okay and sometimes encouraged to look up how to do something online! But if you do:\n        1.  Record the exact URL that had the information that helped you. (This will help improve our instructional materials for next year.)\n        2.  Retype any code yourself, from memory, even if you have to switch back and forth a lot. (This will help *you* internalize what you're borrowing.)\n        3.  Beware that there is lots of *bad* code out there. Strive to do better.\n-   **When** asking for help (and everyone *should* ask for help when they need it), *try to solve the problem on your own first*. This is critical. Then, when you ask for help, share *what you've tried* and *what leads you to think it's not working.* (not just \"It's not working!!\")\n\n# Special Circumstances\n\nOccasionally there are special circumstances that require that course policies be adjusted for a particular student. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the student to inform us of the situation as soon as possible, so that the appropriate arrangements can be made. This includes, but is not limited to, students with documented disabilities.\n\nCalvin University is committed to providing access to all students. If you need additional accommodations to succeed in this class, please contact Disability Services in the Center for Student Success (disabilityservices\\@calvin.edu) as soon as possible to explore what arrangements can be made. The three of us (student, instructor, and Disability Services) will work together to come up with an appropriate solution.\n\nWe will give a grade of Incomplete (I) only in unusual circumstances that have been confirmed by the Student Life office.\n\n# Diversity and Inclusion\n\nI intend for this class to be an environment where we equally respect people of every ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic background, political learning, religious background, etc. And I invite your help.\n\nWe will not always do this well. If you or someone else in this class is hurt by something I say or do in class, I would like to work to remedy it. I'll welcome this feedback in whatever way is comfortable for you: in public, in private, or anonymously, via my department chair (Professor VanderLinden), or via a report to [Safer Spaces](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/safer-spaces/) or the [provost's office](http://www.calvin.edu/go/comments-on-faculty/).\n\n# Etiquette and Wellness\n\nI like to understand education as forming **a community of friends who love knowledge** (and the God from whom all knowledge comes). So as friends and community, we expect to treat each other with respect and courteous communication practices throughout the semester in all venues, including online forums. No personal attacks, trolling, or other kinds of bad language will be tolerated.\n\nWe are not just developing technical skill; we are also developing virtue and character *through the* acquisition of a technical skill. Please, take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nFurthermore, a wide range of things can interfere with your learning: trouble concentrating, stress/anxiety, relationship troubles, family situations, food or housing insecurity, substance use, and many more. You are encouraged to care well for yourself by keeping a consistent sleep schedule, eating well, avoiding drugs and alcohol, exercising, and taking time to relax and connect with friends and family.\n\nAlso, learning how to ask for help is an important part of the college experience. Many people on campus are eager to support you. The [Center for Counseling and Wellness](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/counseling-and-wellness/) sees one out of five students each year and can connect you with a variety of mental health resources on and off campus. You can also reach out to me, another faculty/staff, a friend, or a family member you trust for help getting connected to support. You are not alone, and help is available!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Catalog Description\"}\nAn introduction to the conceptual foundations and practical skills needed to transform data into useful forms and apply predictive analytics to discover patterns and anticipate trends.

If you need additional accommodations to succeed in this class, please contact Disability Services in the Center for Student Success (disabilityservices\\@calvin.edu) as soon as possible to explore what arrangements can be made. The three of us (student, instructor, and Disability Services) will work together to come up with an appropriate solution.\n\nWe will give a grade of Incomplete (I) only in unusual circumstances that have been confirmed by the Student Life office.\n\n# Diversity and Inclusion\n\nI intend for this class to be an environment where we equally respect people of every ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic background, political learning, religious background, etc. And I invite your help.\n\nWe will not always do this well. If you or someone else in this class is hurt by something I say or do in class, I would like to work to remedy it. I'll welcome this feedback in whatever way is comfortable for you: in public, in private, or anonymously, via my department chair (Professor VanderLinden), or via a report to [Safer Spaces](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/safer-spaces/) or the [provost's office](http://www.calvin.edu/go/comments-on-faculty/).\n\n# Etiquette and Wellness\n\nI like to understand education as forming **a community of friends who love knowledge** (and the God from whom all knowledge comes). So as friends and community, we expect to treat each other with respect and courteous communication practices throughout the semester in all venues, including online forums. No personal attacks, trolling, or other kinds of bad language will be tolerated.\n\nWe are not just developing technical skill; we are also developing virtue and character *through the* acquisition of a technical skill. Please, take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nFurthermore, a wide range of things can interfere with your learning: trouble concentrating, stress/anxiety, relationship troubles, family situations, food or housing insecurity, substance use, and many more. You are encouraged to care well for yourself by keeping a consistent sleep schedule, eating well, avoiding drugs and alcohol, exercising, and taking time to relax and connect with friends and family.\n\nAlso, learning how to ask for help is an important part of the college experience. Many people on campus are eager to support you. The [Center for Counseling and Wellness](https://calvin.edu/offices-services/counseling-and-wellness/) sees one out of five students each year and can connect you with a variety of mental health resources on and off campus. You can also reach out to me, another faculty/staff, a friend, or a family member you trust for help getting connected to support. You are not alone, and help is available!\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"filters":["nutshell"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
