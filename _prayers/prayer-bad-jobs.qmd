> Lord, we remember that there are some who find themselves working on projects whose value they doubt or whose likely outcome they disapprove.\
Help them, Lord, to decide whether to stay on in the hope of effecting change or whether to leave.\ 
Especially we pray for those forced by economic necessity to remain in uncongenial work.  \
May they know your forgiveness,\
and may the world of science and technology be ever open to your redeeming Spirit,\
that your will may be fulfilled in all that we do.  \
**Amen**.\
(David Welbourn)
