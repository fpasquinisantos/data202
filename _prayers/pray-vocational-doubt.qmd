> Lord, we pray for ourselves in our daily study and work.\
\
We give thanks for the skills we already have; we pray for wise and good use of these skills in building your kingdom.\
\
We pray for those thinking about changing their study and/or work - especially those unhappy or insecure; those feeling undervalued or unfulfilled; those feeling that are in the wrong place; those who can't wait for 5pm on Friday.\
\
We pray for those with no sense of direction or purpose or vocation, for those drifting,\
for those wanting to do a particular job, but unable through disability, illness, lack of confidence or lack of opportunity;\
for those who are unemployed.
\
We pray for those at school or college now making decisions which will affect our working lives. We pray for all Careers Advisers.\
\
We pray for those who are teaching us;\
for our colleagues,\
for our administrators.
