> We come before You, seeking wisdom and discernment in our work with data. Grant us the understanding to represent information truthfully and fairly, knowing that each data point reflects the reality of lives, stories, and experiences.
>
> Guide our minds as we organize, analyze, and interpret data, so that our actions may honor Your principles of justice and truth. Help us to avoid bias, to present findings transparently, and to use data in ways that uplift and inform rather than mislead or harm.
> 
> May our efforts in data wrangling and analysis be instruments of clarity, bringing light to hidden truths, and contributing positively to the world around us. Teach us to be humble in our knowledge, always seeking to learn and grow, and to use our skills with integrity and care.
> 
> In Your wisdom, we trust. Amen.
