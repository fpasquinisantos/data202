> Let us confess to God those things that are wrong in our work:\
> That the presence of God at work is often overlooked;\
> That creative people are often subjected to long, boring and unrelenting routines;\
> That skills are undeveloped through lack of training;\
> That resources are wasted in shoddy work and the production of unwanted goods;\
> That the maximisation of profit often excludes concern for people;\
> That men and women are discriminated against because of age, race, gender, disability, lack of skill and length of employment;\
> That the poor stand so little chance against the power of the rich, and the world's destitute are forgotten.

> Lord, have mercy upon us. Forgive us our sins and help us to amend our lives. **Amen**.\
