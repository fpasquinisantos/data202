> VERSE 1:\
We bring our time, we bring our treasure,\
we lay them down before Your throne.\
You will make them something greater,\
more than we could ever know. (chorus)\
\
VERSE 2:\
We bring our gifts, we bring our power\
place them in Your sov’reign hand.\
You will take what we have given,\
You will use it for Your plan. (chorus)\
\
CHORUS:\
Glory be to God, the Maker\
glory be to God, Creator\
Take our time, use our treasure\
turn them into something greater:\
Glory be to God, the Maker.\
\
VERSE 3:\
Though our hearts are weak from failure,\
broken dreams and failed attempts,\
show us that in ev’ry season,\
You will fill our emptiness. (chorus)\
