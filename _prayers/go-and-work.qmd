> Go and work\
> Honor the One who is working on you.\
> Do so by making beautiful things,\
> Be serving in beautiful ways,\
> By speaking up for the weak whose beauty is being maligned,\
> By filling this city with the aroma of good and beautiful work
>
> Reflect the beautiful work of your heavenly Father,\
> Nourished now by the grace and mercy of Christ,\
> In the power of the Holy Spirit.
>
> God has already accomplished the great work.\
> God goes before you and behind you.\
> God works at your side.
